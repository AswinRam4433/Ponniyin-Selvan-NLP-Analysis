      "songs; besides, he was engaged in another , more important task:\n",
      "verifying whether the lake did possess seventy-four canals, as he’d\n",
      "heard tell. Thus far, he had traveled one-and-a-half kaadhams  – and\n",

      "How enormous it was, seemingly endless—why , even the so-called\n",

      "execution of plans? For that matter , there was no one who could\n",
      "match his courage and valou r, either . Wasn’t he the warrio r who had\n",

      "banks, whipped by the brisk west wind.\n",
      "By the time Vandhiyathevan reached this point in his rumin ations,\n",
      "he had arrived at the southern end of the lake, and saw the\n",
      "magnificent sight of Vadavaaru emptying itself into it. The lake bed\n",
      "extended for a small stretch  between the banks and the water ’s\n",
      "surface; thorny karuvela  and vila trees had been planted in it to\n",
      "prevent damages to the shore from floods. Sturdy naanal  bushes\n",
      "clustered thickly at the edges. In all, the sight of the Vadavaaru, with\n",
      "water rushing between tree-laden banks and emptying with a roar\n",
      "into the Veera Narayana Lake made a very pretty , colou rful picture\n",
      "indeed, from afar .\n",

      "The auspicious day meant that villagers from in and around the\n",
      "lake were in the mood for celebrations—and scores of men, women,\n",
      "children and even a few aged ones took advantage of the festiveoccasion, dressed in their best clothes and finery , dragging along\n",
      "sapparams  made of delicate, ivory-wh ite coconut fronds. Women\n",
      "wore fragrant blossoms of jasmine, mullai , thaazhambu , sevvandhi ,\n",
      "iruvatchi  and shenbagam , spreading their sweet scent around. Of\n",
      "food, there was plenty as well, in the form of delicious kootanchoru,\n",
      "a mixture of rice and various condiments. Some strolled along the\n",
      "banks, having ladled their food into cups fashioned from kamugu ;\n",
      "other , slightly more adventurous sightseers walked right up to where\n",
      "the Vadavaaru poured into the lake, and ate their food, watching the\n",
      "sight. Children threw their used kamugu  cups into the canals,\n",
      "watched the flimsy containers  tumble through the choppy waters and\n",
      "clapped their hands with glee. Some young men exhibited their\n",
      "playful nature—pulling flowers off their beloveds’ tresses without\n",
      "their knowledg e, throwing them into the canal and laughing to see\n",
      "them burst through on the lake’ s side.\n",
      "Vallavarayan stayed on the banks for a while, enjoying the sights\n",
      "and sounds of celebration. He took in the sweet, appealing melodies\n",
      "of the women—they ranged from boat-songs, to kummi , sindhu  and\n",
      "even some celebrating the floods, in all their delightful variety .\n",

      "sweetness in the tone and verses gladdening his heart.War-like fervour found favour , among other celebrants in the\n",
      "groups. Some women enshrined in song the valour of\n",
      "VijayalayaChozhar , who sported ninety and six scars on his battle-\n",
      "worn body , from thirty-two wars; yet another woman chose to sing\n",
      "about the piety and compas sion of his son Adithya Chozhar who\n",
      "built sixty-four temples for Siva Peruman all along the course of the\n",
      "Kaveri, from its birthplace to where it merged with the sea.\n",
      "ParanthakaChozhar ’s incred ible feats as he subjugated the\n",
      "Pandiyas, Pallavas, Cheras, and won massive victories in Ilankai\n",
      "were sung by a young lady with enormous zest and vigour .\n",
      "Everyone’ s performance was heard with gratifying attention;\n",
      "sometimes, listeners gave themselves completely to them, uttering\n",
      "spontaneous exclamations: “Ah! Ah!”\n",
      "Lost in the revelry , Vandhiyathevan gradually became aware of\n",
      "an old woman’ s scrutiny . “You look like you have travel ed far and\n",
      "hard, Thambi . You must be very tired. Would you like to get down\n",
      "from that horse of yours and share some of our nourishing\n",
      "kootanchoru ?”\n",
      "This seemed to be the signal for every young woman in the\n",
      "vicinity to direct keen glances  at our young man. Their laughing eyes\n",
      "settled on him; they giggled and tittered among themselves,\n",
      "obviously discussing his appearance.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan would have been paralyzed by bashfulness, had\n",
      "not a part of him been overjoyed at the female attention. He\n",
      "wondered, briefly, if he shou ld take up the old woman on her offer\n",
      "and gorge himself on food—b ut surely , if he did, those young women\n",
      "would surround him on all sides and swamp him with ridicule.\n",
      "But what of it? Opportunities to be swamped by a bevy of young\n",
      "ladies did not often come by; even if they did ridicule him, surely the\n",
      "sound of their teasing laughte r would defeat the mellifluous music of\n",
      "celestial beings!\n",
      "To Vandhiyathevan’ s besotted young eyes, every maiden on the\n",
      "shore seemed to be no less a beauty than the divine dancersRambha and Menaka, who adorned Indra’ s court.\n",
      "Before he could accept the old woman’ s invitation, though—\n",
      "something else caught his attention, and made him hesitate.\n",
      "In the distance , a heavenly sight met his eyes: seven or eight\n",
      "large boats glided swiftly along the Vadavaaru from the south-west,\n",
      "their white, silky sails fluttering in the brisk west wind, oars spread\n",
      "like the wings of a graceful swan.\n",
      "Men and women, indulging in celebration along the banks,\n",
      "gradually fell silent, their attention riveted by the approaching\n",
      "spectacle.\n",
      "One among the cavalcade outran the rest, making its way swiftly\n",
      "towards the northern bend of the lake. Soldiers lined its decks;\n",
      "sunlight caught the glint of their spears and javelins, dazzling\n",
      "onlookers. Some of them jumped on shore and began to herd\n",
      "everyone with alacrity: “Clear out! Move away , all of you!”\n",
      "The celebrants themselves, obviously , did not want to lay\n",
      "themselves open to such bracing treatment; they were swift to pick\n",
      "up their belongings and move well away from the banks.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan watched the boats and warriors, puzzled. Who\n",
      "were they, and what sort of passengers did the boats behind them\n",
      "carry? W ere they , perhaps, members of the royal family?\n",
      "He sidled up to an old man who stood on the banks, leaning on\n",
      "his stick. “Ayya, whose men are these? Whom do those swan-like\n",
      "boats belong to? Why do these soldiers drive away the people? And\n",
      "why does everyone obey them?” The questions fairly tripped off his\n",
      "over-eager tongue.\n",
      "“Why , Thambi , do you tell me that you do not recognize them?”\n",
      "the old man raised his eyebrows. “Do you see the boat in the midst\n",
      "of the rest? And the flag that flutters in it? Tell me—w hat is the\n",
      "emblem it bears?”“It seems to be a palm tree.”\n",
      "“Indeed. And do you not know that it is the emblem of the\n",
      "Pazhuvettarayars , my lad?”\n",
      "“Good God,” Vandhiyathevan exclaimed, startled. “Is it truly him?\n",
      "The great warrior Pazhuvettarayar?”\n",
      "“It must be. Who else would dare to brandish the palm-tree flag\n",
      "with such authority?”\n",
      "Vallavarayan’ s eyes turned towards the approaching boats  again,\n",
      "wide with astonishment. Such were the tales he had heard, about\n",
      "the warrior among warriors, Pazhuvettarayar . But then, who had not?\n",
      "The names and fame of the amazingly valiant Pazhuvettarayar\n",
      "brothers, both Elder and Y ounger , had spread through the length and\n",
      "breadth of Chozha Empire, from Eezham in the South, to Kalinga in\n",
      "the North. The brothers hailed from the city of Pazhuvo or on the\n",
      "northern banks  of the River Vada Kaveri, near Uraiyur; their clan had\n",
      "earned a name for valour from the times of Vijayalayar . The\n",
      "Pazhuvoor family claimed intimate ties with the Chozhas through\n",
      "marital alliances; their royal connections and reputation for courage\n",
      "had made them one of the first families of the land, a clan that was\n",
      "almost, if not quite, the equa l of the ancient Chozha dynasty itself.\n",
      "Such an illustr ious status also meant that they were among the few\n",
      "who could boast the privilege of a flag of their own.\n",
      "Of the current duo, the Elder was more renowned, having earned\n",
      "legendary status in twenty-f our battles; for sheer bravery , it was\n",
      "common know ledge that he had no equal in Chozha Nadu. More\n",
      "than fifty years old, he no longer graced battlefields but held several\n",
      "truly exalted positions in the Chozha Empire: Dhana  and\n",
      "DhaanyaAthikaari —Treasurer , and Guardian of Granaries. His was\n",
      "the right to guard the resources of the land, both cash and kind; his\n",
      "also, the privilege to assess the demands of the government, decide\n",
      "on the thirai , or tax to be levied upon and collected from the people.He could march up to any kottam  official, affluent landlord or\n",
      "minister , and demand to be paid whatever tax he levied, that year .\n",
      "In other words, Pazhuvet tarayar was considered next in\n",
      "importance to none other than Maharaja SundaraChozhar himself, in\n",
      "the empire.\n",
      "Naturally , Vandhiyathevan’ s heart was filled with the\n",
      "unquenchable urge to catch a glimpse of this supremely important\n",
      "personality , this warrior who claimed the respect of every Chozha\n",
      "citizen.\n",
      "But then—he remembered the confidential message entrusted to\n",
      "him by Prince AdithaKarikalar , in Kanchi’ s Golden Palace.\n",
      "“Vandhiyatheva! I’m well aware of your prowess as a warrior. I’m\n",
      "also aware of your keen intelligence—which is why I’m entrusting\n",
      "this responsibility to you. Here are two palm-leaves: one is to be\n",
      "delivered to my father , the Maharaja; the other to my sister ,\n",
      "IlaiyaPiratti. I hear such disturbing tales about even highly-placed\n",
      "officials in the empire—you must, therefore, make sure that my\n",
      "message does  not fall into their hands. No matter what position of\n",
      "authority they hold, not a whisper of suspicion must enter their heads\n",
      "that you carry a message from me. Do not, I repeat, do not pick\n",
      "fights along the way. It isn’t enough if you don’t quarrel with anyone\n",
      "—make sure that you ignore  anyone who forces a quarr el on you.\n",
      "Vallavaraya—I know you to be an excellent warrior , so you may be\n",
      "easy about your reputation . Rest assured that ignoring a few\n",
      "disputes isn’t going to be a blemish on your honour .” There was a\n",
      "pause. “In particular , my lad—you must be very wary of the\n",
      "Pazhuvettarayars, and my uncle Madhuranthakar . Not on any\n",
      "account must they know the purpose of your mission!”\n",
      "Such was the message entru sted to him, not just by the Crown\n",
      "Prince of the Chozha Empire, but one who held the vastly important\n",
      "position of MaathandaNaayakar  of the Northern Chozha Forces.\n",
      "AdithaKarikalar had taken such great pains to impress ways of good\n",
      "conduct and behaviour upon him, not to mention precise instructionsto be carried out, that Vallavarayan could not find it in himself to\n",
      "ignore those words of caution. Meeting Pazhuvettarayar , therefore,\n",

      "“How impressive!” exclaimed a guard. “Pray , why not bring along\n",

      "The rest cackled in merriment.\n",
      "“Whatever your title, you cannot enter the palace precincts at this\n",

      "arrived; our master has issued orders not allow anyone else!”\n",
      "By this time, the altercation at the palace entrance had attracted\n",
      "attention; some of the guards who stood chatting just within the\n",
      "gates ambled forward to meet the feuding men. One of them\n",
      "directed a keen glance at the new arrival, and perked up. “Adei, this\n",

      "at this point?\n",
      "Perhaps he ought to just pull out and display Prince\n",

      "“Let go of the reins; I’m leaving,” he announced, and the soldiers\n",
      "released him.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan pressed his heels into the underbelly of his\n",
      "steed; at that very instant, he unsheathed his sword with a hiss, from\n",
      "his scabbard. The flickering lights caught the metal; he swung the\n",

      "resembled Thirumaal, wield ing the divine discus with supreme\n",
      "confidence.\n",
      "The sword cut through the air with finesse. Vandhiyathevan’ s\n",
      "horse sprang through the gates. Soldiers standing on either side\n",
      "sprawled on the ground in an ungainly fashion. A dozen spears,\n",
      "supposed to be held in readiness, clattered to the earth, wholesale.\n",
      "The Pazhuvoor men stood gaping as the horse bounded forward.\n",
      "A lightning-fast counter-attack was the last thing on their minds andwhen it seemed likely that their skulls would be broken, they\n",
      "scattered in every direction.\n",
      "Other events happened at almost the same time: the fort’s\n",
      "enormous gates banged shut—shouts rang all over the entrance—\n",
      "“Get him! Now!” Metal bruised metal as spears were picked up;\n",
      "swords were unsheathed, and the Clang ! Clang ! of weaponry rang\n",
      "through the courtyard. The Palace drums scented danger and\n",
      "banged their warning through the land: Daddam ! Daddam !\n",
      "Twenty , thirty , fifty soldiers surrounded Vandhiyathevan and his\n",
      "horse in an instant; the young  man lost no time and jumped down at\n",
      "once.\n",
      "“Kandamaaraa!” he yelled, brandishing his gleaming sword in a\n",
      "wide arc. “Kandamaaraa! Y our soldiers are murdering me!”\n",
      "The converging men stopped and fell back, suddenly hesitant.\n",
      "“Stop this instant!” A stentorian voice thundered above them,\n",
      "from the upper balconies of the Palace. “What is all the commotion\n",
      "down there?” A few men could be seen in the vicinity of the voice,\n",
      "peering down at the palace entrance.\n",
      "“Master—a man has just broken through the guards, into the\n",
      "palace grounds,” explained a soldier from below . “He mentions the\n",
      "name of our Y oung Master!”\n",
      "“Kandamaaraa!” bellowed that stentorian voice, again. “Get down\n",
      "and see what the uproar is about!” That bellow , Vandhiyathevan\n",
      "speculated, probably belonged to SengannarSambuvaraiyar .\n",
      "He and the men surrounding him stood in place, for the next few\n",
      "minutes.\n",
      "“What’ s happening here?” came a considerably youthful voice.\n",
      "The men promptly stepped aside and made way. A young manstrode swiftly through the ranks and stopped at the extraordinary\n",
      "sight, taken aback.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan stood in the midst of the soldiers, twirling his\n",
      "sword like the valiant lord Subramanya, brandishing his divine\n",
      "weapon.\n",
      "“Good God, my dear man—is it really you?” And Kandamaaran\n",
      "almost ran forward, folding his arms around the warrior in a crushing\n",
      "embrace.\n",
      "“You’ve insiste d time and again that I visit you, but when I finally\n",
      "do—look at the hero’ s welcom e I get,” Vandhiyathevan pointed at the\n",
      "men still surrounding them.\n",
      "“Thick as posts and just as intelligent,” Kandamaaran chided\n",
      "them. “Get lost, you idiots!”\n",
      "-\n",
      "Kandamaaran lost no time in grasping his friend’ s hands, and\n",
      "dragging him through the entrance, into the palace. His feet barely\n",
      "seemed to touch the ground; his heart fairly danced with enthusiasm\n",
      "as he rushed about, eager to point out the sights.\n",
      "Such, after all, is the case when one finds a friend after his own\n",
      "heart, in one’s early years. Oh yes, there was such a thing as\n",
      "romance— but love, even if it brought ecstasy , also came with its fair\n",
      "share of trials, tribulations and heart-aches. But the friendship of\n",
      "youth—ah, nothing existed then but joy and happiness; not even the\n",
      "shadow of sorrow intruded upon it.\n",
      "“By the way, Kandamaaraa,” Vandhiyathevan began, casu ally, as\n",
      "they raced along. “I see the palace overflowing with guest s and their\n",
      "entourage—what seems to be the special occasion? Why this\n",
      "security and guards all over the place?”“I’ll come to that in a minute, but first—remember our days at the\n",
      "military encam pment on the RiverPennai? You’d go on and on about\n",
      "how you wished to meet Pazhuvettarayar , Mazhavarayar , that\n",
      "warrior , and this one—now you can see them all, right down to their\n",
      "staff, bodyguar ds and every stick and stone they own. Right here, in\n",
      "this palace!” Kandamaaran exulted.\n",
      "The first place he took his friend to, when the first ecstasies of\n",
      "meeting were done with, was the section of the palace reserved for\n",
      "esteemed visitors. But before that, came the host.\n",
      "“Appa , haven’t I mentioned often my dearest friend,\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan of the Vaanar clan? Well, here he is,” announced\n",
      "Kandamaaran, standing the young man in front of his father .\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan, true to his birth and breeding, bent low and folded\n",
      "his hands in respect.\n",
      "For some reason, Sambuvaraiyar did not seem very happy with\n",
      "his presence. “Is that so? Were you the reason for all the mayhem\n",
      "below?”\n",
      "“No—our so-called soldiers were,” Kandamaaran explained.\n",
      "“Indeed?” Sambuvaraiyar raised an eyebrow . “If you must know ,\n",
      "Kandamaaraa, I see no reason for your friend’ s arrival half a jaamam\n",
      "after sunset, today—and in such a chaotic fashion too.”\n",
      "Kandamaaran’ s face grew pinched, but it was obvious that he did\n",
      "not want to argue with his father . He took his friend aside and made\n",
      "haste to present him to Pazhuvettarayar , seated majes tically in a\n",
      "richly decorated throne in the midst of them all. “Uncle, here is my\n",
      "dear friend Vandhiyathevan, descended from the illustrious Vaanar\n",
      "dynasty . We served toget her on the border , in the military\n",
      "encampment on the banks of the RiverPennai. It’s been his greatest\n",
      "ambition to meet you, Warrior among Warriors, for long time. I\n",
      "remember; he’d ask me if you really did sport sixty-four battle-scars\n",
      "on your body ,” laughed Kandamaaran. “And I’d often reply , Well, if\n",
      "you’re really that doubtful, you could count them yourself!”“Indeed, Thambi ?” Pazhuvettarayar looked him up and down.\n",
      "“So, you don’t believe that my scars do exist? Or is it your\n",
      "contention, perhaps, that no clan but the Vaanarsis capable of\n",
      "possessing such courage?”\n",
      "The friends stared at him, aghast. Neither had intended the\n",
      "words as anything but extravagant praise—and it had never\n",
      "occurred to them that the warrior would take of fense.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan felt irritation burgeoning within him, but quelled it\n",
      "before his face revealed it. “Ayya, the Pazhuvettarayars’ fame has\n",
      "spread through  the length and breadth of our land, from Imayam to\n",
      "the tip of Kuma ri,” he said, in his most respectful voice. “Who am I to\n",
      "entertain the slightest doubts about their valour?”\n",
      "“Not bad at all,” Pazhuvettarayar acknowledged. “You do possess\n",
      "brains, I see.”\n",
      "There was nothing more to be said; Vandhiyathevan and\n",
      "Kandamaaran made their escape, more relieved than they could say .\n",
      "Sambuvaraiyar took his son aside at the first opportunity . “You had\n",
      "better feed your precious friend and put him to bed somewhere out\n",
      "of everyone’ s way,” he whispered. “He is bound to be exhausted\n",
      "after a long day’ s travel.”\n",
      "Maaravel nodded roughly , plainly furious.\n",
      "Later , Kandam aaran shephe rded his friend to the anthappuram ,\n",
      "the ladies’ quarters, where the women of the royal house hold were\n",
      "assembled in full force. Vandhiyathevan paid his respects here too,\n",
      "falling at the feet of his friend’ s mother and gaining her blessings.\n",
      "The young woman standing well behind the older lady, overcome by\n",
      "shyness must have been, Vandhiyathevan guessed, Kandamaaran’ s\n",
      "sister .\n",
      "The Kadambu r prince had described his young sister in such\n",
      "glowing terms that she had, in his over-active imagination, acquiredthe status of nothing less than a goddess. Now that he had seen her\n",
      "in person, V andhiyathevan was conscious of some disappointment.\n",
      "His eyes roved over the wom en present, gazing keenly at them.\n",
      "Which of them, he wondered, was the woman who had followed\n",

      "as interesting as the story themselves. He wrote Ponniyin Selvan  in the 1950s, which\n",
      "means that many of the Thamizh  phrases he used then are out-of-fashion, today . Take, for\n",
      "instance, the phrase Kandamaaran uses in Thamizh, when he’s telling off his stupid\n",

      "bound by iron on both ends to pound grains; there’ s no chance of it coming alive, or\n",

      "questions at his friend, who stammered and stuttered his answers. A\n",
      "burst of tinkling laughter assaulted him, as well.\n",
      "Perhaps they were laughing at him, Vandhiyathevan wondered,\n",
      "and felt his face grow hot with shame and anger . But there was no\n",
      "more time to be wasted on such thoughts; Kandamaaran re-\n",
      "appeared that very instant. “Come on,” he grabbed his friend’ s hands\n",

      "and balconies,  towers, commemorative plaques, kalasams  and royal\n",
      "stables, Vandhiyathevan put forth his question as nonchal antly as he\n",
      "could. “The ladies seemed to be very merry when you left me to\n",
      "answer their questions—were they so very overjoyed at my arrival?”\n",
      "“They certainly were happy to see you—my mother and the rest\n",

      "“You know , don’t you, that Pazhuvettarayar has married a young\n",
      "woman after all these years, at this advanced age? He’s brought herhere with him in a closed palanquin—but listen to this: he won’t send\n",
      "her to the women’ s quarters! He chooses, instead, to keep her\n",
      "locked up in his own apartment. One of our maids happened to catch\n",
      "sight of her as she peeped into their rooms through the palagani ,\n",
      "and described her in such glowing terms that no one knows what to\n",
      "make of it. They’re now speculating about her birth and identity—\n",
      "maybe she’s from Ilankai, Kalingam or perhaps even the Chera\n",

      "originally hail from those parts?”\n",
      "“Of course; you told me so, yourself,” Vandhiyathevan waved a\n",

      "“Not more than two years, I should think. Rumour has it that he\n",
      "doesn’t leave her alone for a moment; takes his beloved lady with\n",
      "him in a palan quin wherever he goes. People have been trading\n",

      "I’m not putting down your family—merely commenting about their\n",

      "“You know me, Kandamaaraa —I’m hardly the man to be terrified\n",

      "“I’ll confess that I didn’t really  bend my mind to it, at that moment.\n",

      "Large lamps or kuthuvilakkus  and oil-torche s burnt bright in an effort\n",

      "Nine women gathered on the stage, prepared to begin their\n",
      "performance. In accordance with the Koothu  tradition of those times,\n",
      "they wore garments moulded  to their figures and jewellery that set\n",

      "Some held parrots in their hands gracefully , fashioned from\n",
      "sandalwood and painted in a riot of colours.\n",

      "against them; the enormity of the divine power he wielded that\n",

      "himself behind it, leant forward and gazed down.\n",
      "Below him lay a narrow courtyard, enclosed on three sides by\n",

      "to remember why we chose to meet, and come to a decision about\n",

      "and pious ruler, King Kandaradhithar ascended the heavenly abode;\n",
      "his son, Madhuranthaka Thevar was a mere infant, a year old, at that\n",
      "time. It was for this reason that Kandaradhithar wished to place his\n",
      "brother Arinjaya Thevar on the Chozha throne and rule after him; we\n",
      "were informed of his sentiments by his devoted wife, Empress\n",
      "SembianMaadevi. And it was loyalty to our king that made us agree\n",
      "to such  an arrangement. Unfortunately , cruel destiny did not allow\n",
      "Arinjayar to rule for more than a year. His son\n",
      "ParanthakaSundaraChozhar was a strapping young man of twenty\n",
      "years; we, the empire’ s pillars, the ministers, aides, chieftains, lords,kottam  and kootram  officials gathered, discussed the best interests\n",
      "of the country , and crowned him king. There is no doubt that this was\n",
      "an excellent decision; until two years ago, SundaraChozhar gave us\n",
      "no cause to doubt his rule. He consulted us upon royal matters and\n",
      "events prospe red as ever before. Now however , his health is\n",
      "deteriorating—and that circumstance leaves us with certain\n",
      "questions. Kandaradhithar ’s honoured son, Madhurantha ka Thevar\n",
      "is now an extremely capable prince; his piety, accomplishments,\n",
      "intelligence and character make him an eligible contender for the\n",

      "Chozha Forces. My friends—who, among these two men, is worthy\n",
      "of being the heir? I ask you to consider royal tradition and practice,\n",
      "thus far; to consult what Manu Needhi  tells us. What, according to\n",
      "the dictates of fairness and justice, would be your decision? Would\n",
      "you choose Madhuranthaka Thevar , son of the elder\n",

      "“Kandaradhithar ’s son Madhuranthaka Thevar is the rightful heir\n",

      "of the piety of Kandaradhithar ’s son—that he takes no joy in worldly\n",

      "Pazhuvettarayar began, with a preamble. “The whole country knows\n",
      "that Sembian Mahadevi has done everything in her power to turn her\n",
      "son from thoughts of the throne and towards worship of the divine.\n",
      "What neither the country , nor its people know , are her reasons for\n",
      "doing so. Shou ld it ever beco me known that Madhurantha kar wished\n",
      "to asce nd the throne, PeriyaPiratti feared that such knowledge would\n",

      "“Ah! Is that so?” exclaimed several voices.\n",
      "“Indeed. Any mother worth the title would wish her son alive and\n",
      "uncrowned, rather than see him rule and be assassinated.\n",
      "Madhuranthaka Thevar , to whom his mother ’s words are as sacred\n",
      "as the Vedhas, duly devoted  himself completely to God, spurned all\n",
      "worldly pleasures and spent  his time in worship of Siva Peruman.\n",
      "For some time, though, his sentiments have been undergoing a\n",
      "steady change. He has begun to feel that he has a right to ascend\n",
      "the throne, and to wish to govern the country in the best way\n",
      "possible. He is prepared to voice his sentiments in public, once he is\n",
      "secure in the knowledge of your fealty to him—”“And what is the proof of this?”\n",
      "“Certainly , I am prepared to provide as much and more proof, as\n",

      "had believed to be a woman ’s bangle was in fact a kanganam , an\n",
      "ornament usually worn by princes. The next instant, that face, the\n",

      "error, still eavesdropping on the scene?\n",
      "Tree branches shadowed that section of the fort wall, however ,\n",
      "and nothing could be seen.\n",
      "By this time, the courtyard below was resounding with ferocious\n",
      "shouts and chants: “Long live Madhuranthaka Thevar! Long live the\n",
      "Crown Prince!” Men unsheathed their swords, raised their spears,\n",
      "and their voices to the heavens. “ Vetrivel ! Veera vel !”\n",
      "To remain here anymore  would lead to complications;\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan slipped away from the pillar, returned to his bed in\n",

      "Too late, he realized his mistake and ignorance in even attempting it:\n",
      "the wicked current grabbed  hold and simply pulled him under .\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan thrashed round and round, limbs paralyzed by the\n",

      "Pennai was going to be his watery , unmarked grave—a sudden swirl\n",
      "caught him, and practically threw him out. Vandhiyathevan praised\n",
      "every deity he had ever heard  of as he washed upon the shore in an\n",
      "exhausted heap, and made a miraculous escape.\n",
      "Lying on his bed in a balcony of the Sambuvaraiyar palace that\n",
      "night, he was conscious of the same, helpless feeling—caught\n",
      "unawares in a crippling whirlpool. Except that this time, it was not a\n",
      "river—at least not in the literal sense—but an enormous, vicious\n",
      "royal conspiracy . Would he be able to escape this one’s clutches the\n",
      "same way?\n",
      "What he had learnt, eavesd ropping on the meeting that night,\n",
      "almost overwhelmed him. It had been only a few years after all,\n",
      "since the Chozha empire shook off endless onslaughts from external\n",
      "factors; for a while now, its people had been able to breathe easy,\n",
      "unafraid of invasions. Crown Prince AdithaKarikalar was responsible\n",
      "a good deal for this state of affairs: a soldier through and through, an\n",
      "expert in war strategies, and almost a Chanakya when it came to\n",
      "battling enemie s, he utilized Chozha armies and resources to their\n",
      "fullest, and released ThondaiMandalam completely from theshackles of RettaiMandalam’ s King Krishna. That had taken care of\n",
      "foes from without.\n",
      "What though, of the enemies who threatened the empire from\n",
      "within? Weren’t they a great deal more dangerous? What would be\n",

      "and power that the Pazhu vettarayar brothers commanded—was\n",
      "there anyone else, except perhaps the Maharaja, who could rival\n",
      "them? And what of the other kings and lords present? Each was\n",
      "powerful in his own right, lord of considerable territories  and man-\n",
      "power . Not to mention their fame in battle, as well. Was this the first\n",
      "time they had gathered? Or had there been other clandestine\n",
      "meetings, with Madhuranthakar hiding away in closed palanquins?\n",
      "Ah, Pazhuvettarayar ’s marriage at such a late date had had its uses!\n",
      "Until that evening, not the lightest doubt had invaded\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan’ s mind about the succession. AdithaKarikalar was\n",
      "the undisputed  Crown Prince, the choice of both King and country; it\n",
      "had never occurred to him that there might be competition  from other\n",
      "quarters. Like most citizens, he knew of Madhuranthakar of course,\n",
      "and had heard tales of Kandaradhithar ’s son immersing  himself in\n",
      "worship and saintly pursuits.  Not for an instant had he entertained\n",
      "the suspicion that Madhuranthakar might have an actual claim on the\n",
      "throne—or that he might consider himself a contender for it.\n",
      "But—to quote someone in the meeting itself—what was right, as\n",
      "per the dictates of justice and fairness? Was AdithaKarikalar the\n",
      "lawful heir to the throne—or Madhuranthakar?\n",
      "The more Vandhiyathevan mulled over it, the more did he feel\n",
      "that both claim s had equal merit. If they did decide to contest each\n",
      "other ’s rights, who would win? And what would be his own position, if\n",
      "it came down to a pitched battle?Ah, the dream s Vandhiyathev an had cherished when he first set\n",
      "out from Kanchi! The castles in air he had built, hoping to ascend to\n",
      "a great position in the empire under the aegis of the Crow n Prince—\n",
      "why, at one point, he had even nurtured hopes of winning back the\n",
      "Vaanar ’s ancient kingdom, and restoring them to their former glory!\n",
      "And now—now  the very branch he had chosen, to clam ber onto a\n",
      "magnificent tree, seemed about to splinter .\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan tossed and turned in his bed for a long time,\n",
      "plagued by doubts and conje ctures. The fourth jaamam  had arrived\n",
      "and with it dawn, when he finally succumbed to sleep a second time.\n",
      "The result of all this was that he did not wake up early; not even\n",
      "when the sun’s red-hot rays scorched him the next morn ing. It took\n",
      "Kandamaaran’ s good-natured slap to bring him to awareness;\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan jerked awake, startled out of his wits.\n",
      "“Slept well?” enquired the Kadambur prince, after the usual\n",
      "practice of hosts. Then he volunteered, “I did come here late last\n",
      "night—but you were so immersed in your worship of Kumbakarnan\n",
      "that I didn’t have the heart to disturb your penance,” he grinned.\n",
      "It took a great  deal of forbea rance for Vandhiyathevan to clamp\n",
      "down the word s that bubbled up his throat, but he did. “I remember\n",
      "lying down here after the KuravaiKoothu , but nothing else. Ah, it\n",
      "looks like almost a jaamam  has passed since daybreak— I must start\n",
      "at once. Kandamaaraa, do instruct your men to saddle my horse!”\n",
      "“Well, here’s a good one! What do you mean, you have to leave\n",
      "at once? There’ s no hurry; stay a while, perhaps ten days.”\n",
      "“I’m afraid I can’t, my friend. I’ve had news that my uncle is in a\n",
      "very bad way, in Thanjavur—apparently , he’s on his deathbed,”\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan rattled of f, perjuring his soul without a qualm. “I must\n",
      "set of f at once if I ever hope to see him.”\n",
      "“In that case, you must promise to stop here, on your way back.”“By all means. Now , please let me take my leave.”\n",
      "“Such haste! Do but settle down for a while, until at least morning\n",
      "meal. I’d like to accompany you as far as the Kollidam.”\n",
      "“But—how can you? With so many important visitors vying for\n",
      "your attention—”\n",
      "“No one here is more importa nt to me than you –!” Kandamaaran\n",
      "bit his lip, and paused. “It’s true that we’re entertaining esteemed\n",
      "guests at the moment, but they have my father to play host and the\n",
      "palace officials , besides. I couldn’t talk to you for even a while last\n",
      "night. I was hoping we migh t, on our way to the Kollidam. I shan’t\n",
      "rest until we do—and I’m coming with you, no matter what!”\n",
      "“I’ve no objection, in that case,” Vandhiyathevan acquiesced. “Do\n",
      "as you please.”\n",
      "A naazhigai  later saw the two friends canter off on their horses\n",
      "from Sambuvaraiyar ’s palace. Their pace was slow; the morning,\n",
      "mellow and peaceful. So engrossed were the young men in\n",
      "reminiscing their past that neither paid any attention to the rustling\n",
      "west wind, showering them with clouds of dust.\n",
      "“I may have stayed at your palace just for a night, Kanda maaraa\n",

      "casually , after a while. “I’m a little disappointed about just one thing,\n",
      "though. All those endless descriptions you gave of your sister ’s\n",
      "remarkable beauty on the banks of Vada Pennai—and I could barely\n",
      "catch a glimpse of her, last evening! All I could see when she\n",
      "peeped from behind her mother , was an eighth of her face. My\n",
      "friend, I’m frustrated! Thamiz h girls ought to behave with decorum\n",
      "and a proper degree of bashfulness—but your sister has a little too\n",
      "much of them, I tell you!”\n",
      "Kandamaaran’ s lips trembled with the urge to speak—bu t not a\n",
      "word came out.“Never mind, though,” Vandhiyathevan prattled on. “You’ve\n",
      "invited me to stay for a few days on my journey back home, after all.\n",
      "Be sure that I’ll take every opportunity to remedy these shy silences!\n",
      "Your sister wouldn’t think of hiding behind her mother ’s back when\n",
      "she’s known me for a while, would she? By the way—wh at did you\n",
      "say her name was?”\n",
      "“Manimekalai.”\n",
      "“Ah, a truly sweet name! Now, if she were only as pretty and\n",
      "good-humoured as her name suggests—”\n",
      "Kandamaaran cut in, at this point. “My friend, I beg of you— forget\n",
      "my sister. Forget what I said about her as well. Don’t ever bring her\n",
      "up, again!”\n",
      "“Good God, this is a turnaround! What on earth happened  to last\n",
      "evening’ s speeches about of fering me a son-in-law’ s welcome?”\n",
      "“I don’t deny that I said a great many things—but do ignore them,\n",

      "well.”\n",
      "Well done, my girl, mused Vandhiyathevan. It did not seem\n",
      "difficult either , to guess the identity of the probable groom—who else\n",
      "but the royal Madhuranthakar , occupant of a closed palanquin, would\n",
      "do for them? It was obvious that they were garnering as many\n",

      "moments, and ask me if we’re on earth or Kailasam !”\n",
      "Then, she turned her attentio n to him—and her voice went very\n",
      "low. “I came here, Ayya, to consult you about something important.\n",
      "I’ve been hearing disturbing talk among people, lately; towns and\n",
      "cities are full of news that upsets me. I see a comet in the sky too,\n",

      "calamity for the empire? Perhaps—perhaps ill fortune truly is upon\n",
      "us?”\n",
      "“My lady, kindly do not ask me about empires, affairs of state or\n",
      "kingly dominions. Such things do not possess horoscopes; neither\n",
      "do they lend themselves to forecasts. Perhaps the only men who can\n",
      "divine their futures are sages , saints and other yogis with the powerto predict such things. I am but a poor astrologer with meager\n",
      "resources; such things are beyond me. Stars, charts, planets and\n",
      "moon become powerless before the might of an empire and its\n",
      "machinations …”\n",
      "“How very diplomatic, Ayya. Cleverly phrased, too. Pred icting an\n",
      "empire’ s future might be beyond your meager means—but  surely not\n",
      "those of my father and brothers? Divining their futures would be the\n",
      "same as divining the empire’ s, wouldn’t it?”\n",
      "“Certainly , Amma , but that is a task for another day. In general,\n",
      "these are hazardous times for all, filled with confusion and danger . It\n",
      "would serve us well to exercise great caution.”\n",
      "“My father ’s move from Pazhaiyarai to Thanjavur worries me\n",
      "greatly .”\n",
      "“I said this before, Amma ; a great adversity is about to befall the\n",
      "Maharaja—indeed, these are trying times for everyone in your family .\n",
      "They will face the gravest dangers. By Goddess Durga’ s grace,\n",
      "though, every single stroke of ill fortune shall dissipate, and the fates\n",
      "will smile again.”\n",
      "A frail voice reached them, at that moment. “Akka ? Where are\n",
      "we?” Vanathi gazed up from where she lay in Kundhavai’ s lap, eyes\n",
      "wide, like a flower unfurling its delicate petals, lids flutte ring like a\n",
      "bird’s.\n",
      "“My heart’ s dearest! The celestial PushpakaV imanam  hasn’t\n",

      "with our own paltry chariot and horses, to return to the palace.”\n",
      "Vanathi sat up slowly . “Did I faint?”\n",
      "“Certainly not, my love. You simply decided to take a nap in my\n",
      "lap for a while . I even sang a lullaby—didn’t the lilting notes fall on\n",
      "your charming ears?”“Pray—pray don’t be angry , Akka . I could n’t help myself. My head\n",
      "spun so—”\n",
      "“I’m not surprised your head  spun a pretty dance—mine would\n",
      "have too, if this wily astrologer had rattled off such dazzling\n",

      "“Dazzling predictions— Akka , you don’t really think I’d believe\n",
      "such things, do you?”\n",
      "“Regardless of what you believe, my dear, you did succeed in\n",
      "frightening him out of his wits! I’ve decided never to take such a little\n",
      "coward anywhere, ever again—”\n",
      "“I did tell you that I didn’t want to come here, Akka . But you said\n",
      "–”\n",
      "“My fault, of course. Now, get up. Will my lady take a few steps to\n",
      "the front door—or must I tuck you onto my hip?”\n",
      "“Oh, no, please! I can walk by myself.”\n",
      "“Just a moment, Amma . Kindly accept Devi’ s prasadham  before\n",
      "you leave.” The astrologer began to gather his palm-leaves and tie\n",
      "them up.\n",
      "“Jothidar , you’ve predicted so much about me—but you haven’t\n",
      "said anything about Akka ’s future,” spoke up V anathi.\n",
      "“Amma , I have  forecast hers, as well. Besides, there is nothing I\n",

      "“IlaiyaPiratti’ s prince, this sukumaarar  is to come soon, isn’t he?”\n",
      "asked V anathi eagerly . “When? And where will he be from?”\n",
      "“Indeed, he will arrive, my lady . Very, very soon.”\n",
      "“Ah, but the question is—how will he make his superb entrance?\n",
      "Will he stomp in on an eleph ant? Trot in on a horse? Clatter by in a\n",
      "chariot? Tramp by on foot?” quipped Kundhavai, gaily. “Or simply\n",
      "crash through the roof like a God and reveal his divine presence?”\n",
      "“There —! I can hear hooves!” exclaimed V anathi.\n",
      "“Such excellent faculties, my dear, to catch something that\n",
      "doesn’t exist.”\n",
      "“I’m not teasing you, Akka —do listen!”\n",
      "And indeed, they did hear hooves clattering along the street at a\n",
      "furious pace.\n",
      "“What of it? This is Kudandhai city, after all; horses must be\n",
      "commonplace on the streets,” explained Kundhavai.\n",

      "“You and your silly fantasies. Get up now; time to leave.”\n",
      "Precisely at this moment, a clamour of voices reached them from\n",

      "interspersed with shouts and a cacophony of sounds.\n",
      "“This is the astrologer ’s home, isn’t it?”\n",

      "“Shoo! Get away—or I’ll mow you down—!”\n",
      "“Ayya, please do not enter the house! Please do not—!”\n",
      "Dadaar ! The door was flung open with a crash. A young man\n",
      "made an explosive entrance  into the room. Another was almost at\n",
      "heels, catching  him by his shoulders in a vain bid to pull him away .\n",
      "The young man wrenched himself from the latter and took a forceful\n",
      "step across the threshold, and into the room.\n",
      "Our readers may have guessed the identity of this intrepid\n",

      "The eyes of all three within the room, focused themselves  on the\n",
      "new entrant at once.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan, in turn, directed his attention on those within.\n",
      "No, that would  not be quite correct. His eyes fastened onto only one\n",
      "person in the room—and even then, he did not quite manage to see\n",
      "Princess Kundhavai all at once.\n",
      "He took in her fair countenance, radiant as the golden full moon.\n",
      "Ah, but not even all her face at the same time! He saw her lips,gleaming red corals, parted slightly in surprise; he saw her eyes—\n",
      "large, brilliant and brimming  with laughter , mischief, astonishment\n",
      "and yes, the aura of majesty that pervaded her; every perfect\n",
      "eyelash, and brows that curved gently over them; the forehead,\n",
      "delicately tinted in ivory; rosy cheeks, dimpling in a smile ; a slender\n",
      "neck, with the silken smoo thness of a conch, translucent in its\n",
      "beauty .\n",
      "He saw all these at the same , as separate images. And that was\n",
      "how they fixed themselves in his mind, as well—with  startling,\n",
      "brilliant clarity .\n",
      "All this had happened within the space of a few seconds. Now,\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan seemed to shake himself, and turned to glare at the\n",
      "astrologer ’s disciple. “Why , you little—why couldn’t you have warned\n",
      "me that there were females inside—! I wouldn’t have barged in if I’d\n",
      "known –” and he pushed away the man almost roughly , retreating in\n",

      "It took only a few moments for Vandhiyathevan to take all this in\n",

      "tree’s thick roots. Its mouth gaped wide, teeth jagged and sharp.\n",

      "Kollidam; he had also heard what frightening predators they were.\n",
      "This one particularly , brough t his worst fears to the surface and\n",
      "set his nerves jangling with tension. Not only did it seem ready for a\n",
      "human feast, it was very near the laughing young wome n as well,mouth open wide as if to chomp upon them. All it had to do was\n",
      "pounce forward —and they would be torn to pieces! The banks were\n",
      "thick with clusters of trees; there was really no way for the women to\n",
      "break through and escape.\n",
      "His heart may have been murky with confused feelings, but\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan’ s resolve did not falter an instant. Neither did he\n",
      "spend time pondering his course of action: he hefted his trusty spear ,\n",
      "took aim and threw it. The weapon cleaved through the air and\n",
      "struck the crocodile, sure and true, penetrating its thick skin and\n",
      "plunging in a little. At once, Vandhiyathevan sprang forwa rd with his\n",

      "But—but why were these women laughing, just like before?\n",

      "He stopped short, suddenly unsure. Not a vestige of fear was on the\n",

      "with mirth. Certainly , they did not seem to be the young ladies who\n",

      "One of them—the majestic young woman he had seen at the\n",

      "she’s taken the girl to the astrologer to—to instate enquiri es, as they\n",

      "“Vanathi’ s fainting fits? All an act,” supplied another . “It’s her plan\n",

      "“Not at all. The fact that he asked after her only show s how\n",

      "a ruler? Which throne would he ever grace? On the other hand,\n",
      "humans were incapable of understanding God’ s will or His divine\n",
      "plans. The world was huge; thousands of rajyams  and empires\n",

      "with incredible courage and indomitable will, weren’t there ? Hadn’t a\n",

      "fell to the ground in an explosion of sound.\n",
      "Ah, how inauspicious ! —was the thought that flitted through the\n",

      "crumpled to the ground, unconscious.\n",
      "The rest of the women, following Kundhavai’ s command, swiftly\n",

      "walked into the room Vanathi was laid in, and saw his sister trying\n",
      "desperately to bring that young woman around as she lay against\n",
      "her shoulder . The sight was enough to melt his heart.\n",

      "fret, Vanathi—these things happen to the best of us. And you, in\n",
      "particular , have  more reason than any to be overwhelme d. In fact, I\n",

      "The rest of Princess Kundhavai’ s handmaidens observed this\n",

      "through window s that liberally dotted the palace. A spark of jealousy\n",
      "was kindled in their hearts—which swiftly burst into a roaring flame.\n",
      "For, ever since then, Kundhavai made Vanathi her especial\n",
      "friend, and began to take a keen interest in that young lady. The two\n",
      "were inseparab le; Kundhava i showered Vanathi with affection. Fine\n",
      "arts, music or skills—she taught her everything she knew , and the\n",
      "two were rarely apart. Kundh avai often took her young friend to the\n",
      "royal gardens where she spoke at length about her brother ’s\n",
      "fortunes, her own dreams, and the grand future she had imagined for\n",
      "him. T o all this, V anathi listened with rapt and gratifying attention.\n",
      "The Kodumbal ur maiden fainted four of five times more, after this\n",

      "consciousness.\n",
      "The younger girl would come to, sobbing as if her heart would\n",
      "break, each time. “Silly girl!” Kundhavai would remonstrate, and\n",
      "console her as best as she could. “Come, now—dry your tears, do.\n",
      "Why do you weep this way?”\n",
      "“I—I don’t know, Akka,” Vanathi would sob more. “Forgive me,\n",

      "And Kundhava i would embrace her, soothing her with soft words\n",
      "of reassurance and comfort.\n",

      "Variations include applying a dark mark of mai (khol) on the face but in Thamizhagam,\n",
      "this was usually reserved for babies and very young children. As Arulmozhi was considered\n",

      "were not looked upon as lustful objects. This evolved into a social constr uct: unfamiliar\n",

      "His patience paid off; soon enough, Idumbankaari, he was\n",
      "gratified to see, did not climb into the boat but walked back, staring\n",
      "hard at the arasu  tree all the while. Then he looked in all four\n",
      "directions keenly , as though to ascertain that Azhwarkkadiyaan truly\n",
      "had left—and arrived at the bottom of the tree himself. He glanced\n",
      "around him once again and then made himself comfortable\n",
      "underneath it. Judging by the number of glances he cast about, he\n",
      "seemed to expect someone, or something—but the one place he\n",

      "anything, even if he had—Thirumalai had concealed himself so\n",
      "perfectly that neither hair nor hide could be glimpsed.Approximately a naazhigai  passed, thus; Nambi’ s legs had gone\n",
      "to sleep. He was not sure how long he could stay this way, lodged\n",
      "within the cramped confines of a tree—but Idumbankaari seemed to\n",
      "have no intention of budging. Thirumalai considered his options:\n",
      "there was no way to leave without rousing his attention;  no matter\n",
      "how stealthily he clambered down the other side, some little noise\n",
      "was sure to be heard. Idumbankaari had the ears of a lynx cat—and\n",
      "a sharp little knife, to boot. What was the guarantee that he would\n",
      "not hesitate to plunge it in Thirumalai’ s chest?\n",
      "Well, what else was he supposed to do, then?  Could he,\n",
      "perhaps, jump down on Idumbankaari himself, screaming like the\n",
      "ghost that was supposedly possessing this tree? The man might  be\n",
      "fooled— even faint from horror . Or Thirumalai might just make a run\n",
      "for it—\n",
      "At this moment, his penance seemed to come to an end.\n",
      "A man approached the tree from the southwest—that is, from the\n",
      "road to Kudandhai. Some instinct warned Thirumalai that this was\n",
      "whom Idumbankaari had been awaiting, all this while. He was right.\n",
      "The latter stood as the man neared.\n",
      "The new arrival mimicked the hand gesture Idumbankaari had\n",

      "confidence like Thirumaal wielding his discus. He ploughed through\n",

      "there if they could help it and soon, the forest began to creep over\n",
      "the land. Slowly but surely , the jungle reclaimed the scene of\n",
      "bloodshed and with it, the monument. Jackals made their home\n",
      "among thick bushes; owls and other night-birds roosted in the dark,\n",
      "gloomy trees. In course of time, the memorial lost the few visitors\n",
      "who had braved jungle and wild animals for worship; the temple\n",
      "began to fall apart. At the time of our story , it was practically in ruins.\n",
      "It was here that Azhwarkkadiyaanarrived, at dusk. Terrifying\n",
      "demons, carved in glorious detail guarded the crumbling wreck and\n",
      "glared balefull y at Nambi, from atop the edges of the temple’ s\n",
      "mandapam . Their stony stares bounced off the rotund man\n",
      "harmlessly—he was hardly the type to be nervous at their presence.\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan sprang as nimbly as he could onto the roof of the\n",
      "monument’ s mandapam  and scrambled to hide himself among a few\n",
      "tree branches. His sharp eyes were capable of cutting across the\n",
      "dense gloom; his ears perked, ready to catch the slightest sound.\n",
      "The sun sank beyond the horizon. A naazhigai  passed—then\n",
      "two, and three. Night lay on the forest like a heavy blanket; to\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan, the murky darkness was stifling. Occasionally ,\n",
      "something rustled through the undergrowth— ah, there is a weasel,\n",
      "climbing up a tree! And here, an owl screeches through the night.Some kind of bird flutters agitatedly up to another branch, alarmed\n",
      "by the approaching weasel. And yes —jackals have begun to howl .\n",
      "A muted noise sounded above; Azhwarkkadiyaan craned his\n",
      "neck up. A squirrel or a chameleon—he was not quite sure which;\n",
      "some small animal—scrambled up the tree.\n",
      "He could see patches of the night sky through the thick, leafy\n",
      "branches. Stars winked down at him. Struggling to be comfortable\n",
      "among the stifling foliage in splendid isolation, waiting for God knew\n",
      "what, these stars in the heavens seemed to be the only friendly\n",
      "souls within sight. Azhwarkkadiyaan began, it must be admitted, a\n",
      "one-sided conversation with them. “Ah, beloved stars that swim in\n",
      "the waters of the night! You look like you’re laughing at the stupidity\n",
      "of us humans down here. I suppose you have reason to. After all,\n",
      "you were witne ss to the bloody battle that was fought at this site a\n",
      "hundred years  ago, weren’t you? And the rivers of blood that bathed\n",
      "this very earth . I’m quite sure you’re wondering why men should be\n",
      "at each other ’s throats all the time, or be so fond of spilling blood.\n",
      "You see, most would call this valour .\n",
      "A man has been dead for a hundred years—and yet, they call\n",
      "him their foe! This, you see, is apparently the enemy’ s monument.\n",
      "They’re going to confer about destroying those alive—in  a temple\n",
      "dedicated to a dead man! Why wouldn’t you laugh, oh twinkling\n",
      "stars? Of course you will—by all means, do!”\n",
      "Good God, is all this a wild goose chase, then? Am I doomed to\n",
      "be cramped between these branches all night? Are those men never\n",
      "going to arrive? Perhaps my ears were at fault, and I heard them\n",
      "wrong? Or, perhaps those fish-signing men had simply changed their\n",
      "minds and gone elsewhere? Ah, what a disappointment, if so?\n",
      "Should nothing  happen here tonight, I shall never forgive myself —\n",
      "wait! There —there’ s a light. Ah, now it’s gone. Now I see it again.\n",
      "There’ s no doubt about it; someone approaches with a torch. No,\n",
      "there are two men. My wait was not in vain —!The two newcomers walked a little beyond the pallippadai ,\n",
      "towards a little clearing in the dense jungle. One sat down; the other\n",
      "held aloft the torch and looked around, obviously expecting someone\n",
      "else. A while later , two more arrived—fearless men and obviously , no\n",
      "strangers to this place. Else how could they possibly find their way\n",
      "through well-nigh impenetrable forest in pitch darkness?\n",
      "The latest arrivals spoke something to the men already\n",
      "assembled—but Azhwarkk adiyaan heard nothing of their\n",
      "conversation. Adada , what a waste  of all his efforts—why , it looked\n",
      "like he wouldn’t even be able to recognize these plotters!\n",
      "Two more men arrived; the group conferred amongst themselves\n",
      "again. The last of the newcomers held a bag in his hand; he turned\n",
      "it, mouth towards the ground —and gold coins tumbled to the earth,\n",
      "glinting in the torch-light.\n",
      "“My friends!” The man with the bag let loose a maniacal chortle.\n",
      "“Witness the beginning of Chozha Nadu’ s destruction at our hands—\n",
      "with gold from her own coffers! Excellent, wouldn’t you say?” And he\n",
      "laughed even more.\n",
      "“Lower your voice, Ravidasar ,” advised one. “Let’s not scream\n",
      "everything to the high heavens.”\n",
      "“Ah, but who is going to eavesdrop on us in this desolate jungle?\n",
      "Jackals, owls and weasels, perhaps?” snorted the afore-mentioned.\n",
      "“But they won’t tell on us, thankfully .”\n",
      "“Even so, it’ s safer to talk in low tones, isn’t it?”\n",
      "And then they really did begin to converse in murmurs—which,\n",
      "unfortunately , did not bode well for Azhwarkkadiyaan at all, whose\n",
      "ears were not sharp enough to divine their words. There was no\n",
      "point, he thoug ht, in staying atop the monument—perhap s he ought\n",
      "to climb  down  and approach them. For he had to know what they\n",
      "spoke—he had to. And if there be any danger that came with\n",
      "eavesdropping on them—so be it.Azhwarkkadiyaan duly made an attempt to slip down from his\n",
      "perch—but his body brushed against the tree, rustling the foliage.\n",
      "Two of the men sprang up with a growl. “Who is there?”\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan’ s heart skipped a few beats. There was no way\n",
      "out, now, but to make his escape. And even then, they would\n",
      "certainly hear him blundering through the jungle, wouldn’t they?\n",
      "Just at this moment, an owl spread out and flapped its wings.\n",
      "“Oom —oom!” it hooted ominously , in the still night.\n",
      "•\n",
      "Hidden Meanings and Explanations\n",
      "Vinmeen\n",
      "This is a beautiful Thamizh word to describe stars. Literally , it means “sky-fish” —fish\n",
      "swimming in the ocean that is the sky .20\n",
      "“The first foe!”\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan delivered a deeply heartfelt thanks to the owl\n",
      "that had just fluttered through the trees—for , the men gathered in the\n",

      "“No, stay! Let’s keep our swords and knives sharp for other ,\n",
      "worthy purpos es—such as beheading our enemies and destroying\n",
      "their very roots,” advised Ravidasan. “What have owls and night-\n",
      "birds ever done to us after all? They are, in fact, our friends—unlike\n",
      "other men, they’re awake all hours of the night, aren’t they? Just like\n",
      "us?\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan, listening to this speech, crept forward on\n",
      "noiseless feet towards a towering marudha  tree. More than a\n",
      "hundred years  old, the ancient one’s thick roots had sprawled all\n",
      "over the ground. There were large spaces between one gnarly limb\n",
      "and another , and even a cozy hollow underneath the trunk.\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan made the best of his hidey-hole, leant against the\n",
      "tree and eavesdropped for all he was worth.\n",
      "“Where gold is concerned, we’re secure as long as Thanjavur ’s\n",
      "royal treasury continues to patronize us,” began Ravidas an. “All we\n",
      "need, now, is the courage to fulfill our pledge and the strength to\n",
      "keep our secret until our work is done. Hear this: we must split\n",
      "ourselves into two groups—o ne will leave for Ilankai; the other will\n",
      "journey towards ThondaiMandalam and await the right opportunity to\n",
      "carry out their task. And remember—both must be complete at\n",
      "exactly the same time! Shou ld there be the slightest lapse after thefirst foe’s demise, the second will be on the alert. And that, we must\n",
      "never allow .  Now—which of us is prepared for the task in Ilankai?”\n",
      "“I will!”—“No, let me!” clamoured several voices all at once.\n",
      "“We’ll decide that by and by, at our next meeting in Pandiya Nadu\n",
      "— but there are a few things  that must be completed before we get\n",
      "to it.”\n",
      "“Which would be the best route to Ilankai?” queried someone.\n",
      "“Kodikkarai is an excellent option, should we choose the sea-\n",
      "route. But traveling there, in the first place, would be perilous—a\n",
      "great many enemies abound , not to mention every spy in the land.\n",
      "Far better to journey towards  Sethu instead, cross the sea and land\n",
      "at Maat hottam or thereabouts . Those who opt for the Ilankai mission\n",
      "must be prepa red to row a boat, a canoe, and swim in the sea\n",
      "competently . Which of us here can do the last?”\n",
      "“I can!”—“So can I!” came several enthusiastic answers.\n",
      "“Our first task there would be to call upon King Mahi ndan—\n",
      "nothing can be decided without an audience with him. Therefore, it\n",
      "becomes important that at least one of those journeying to Ilankai\n",
      "knows the Sinhala language. Ah—but where’ s our Soman\n",
      "Saambavan? Hasn’t he arrived yet? Did anyone amongst us see\n",
      "him, before this?”\n",
      "“Here I am,” came a voice very near Azhwarkkadiyaan, and he\n",
      "almost jumped out of his skin.\n",
      "Nambi practically plastered himself to the tree, mourning, not for\n",
      "the first time, his rotund physique that simply would not let him\n",
      "conceal himself anywhere in peace.\n",
      "He was just in time to notice  two more men join the gathering.\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan peered around the tree a very little, and caughtsight of them: they were, indeed, the ones he had spied talking\n",

      "“Welcome!” exulted Ravidasan. “I was concerned that you might\n",
      "have been in danger—that perhaps you wouldn’t arrive at all. Which\n",
      "path did you choose and from where?”\n",
      "“The one along the Kollidam—but a group of jackals surrounded\n",
      "us on the way and we had a difficult time escaping them,” explained\n",
      "Soman Saambavan.\n",
      "“I can understa nd fearing lions and tigers—but why be terrified of\n",
      "jackals?” mocked one of the men. “What can we expect of those who\n",
      "falter at the sight of them , pray?”\n",
      "“Ah, but that’s where you’re wrong. One can confront ferocious\n",
      "lions and tigers—they attack alone, face-to-face, and it’s easy to get\n",
      "the better of them. Jackals, now—those wretched animals always\n",
      "hunt in large groups and are stronger , as a result. Wasn’t that how\n",
      "those Chozhas  hunted down our illustrious king, who was caught all\n",
      "alone? Would he have lost his precious life if he hadn’t been mown\n",
      "down by those cowardly scavengers?”\n",
      "“We shall hunt down and destroy those dastardly jackals—right\n",
      "down to the last little pup!” Soman Saambavan growled an oath.\n",
      "“And behold!— the tools of such destruction,” and Ravidasan\n",
      "displayed the heap of gold coins glinting in the torch-light.\n",
      "Soman Saambavan picked up one, and inspected it carefully .\n",
      "“The emblem of a tiger on one side—and a palm-tree on the other!”\n",

      "“Indeed. Chozh a gold—with the Pazhuvettarayar ’s emblem . I, as\n",
      "you see, have kept my promise,” announced Ravidasan. “What\n",
      "about you, now? I expect Idumbankaari has some news for us?”\n",
      "“He has, and is quite ready to tell you.”Idumbankaari, accordingly , began his tale: “I have duly followed\n",
      "your instruction s, and am now employed in the Kadambur household\n",
      "as a servant. But it was only yesterday that I had the chance to\n",
      "stumble upon something important. The Sambuvaraiyars hosted a\n",
      "banquet last night, and a great many lords were present—\n",
      "Pazhuvettarayar , VanangamudiMunaiyarayar ,\n",
      "MazhapaadiMazhavaraiyar and the like. The Velan Dance and\n",
      "KuravaiKoothu were performed, and the Devaralan delivered a few\n",
      "predictions that will aid our mission very well. Everyone believed that\n",
      "Pazhuvettarayar ’s young queen had accompanied him in her closed\n",
      "palanquin. Pazhuvettarayar gave the news that King\n",
      "SundaraChozhar was quite ill, and not likely to survive much longer .\n",
      "Then, all of them decided that AdithaKarikalar did not deserve to be\n",
      "crowned king but Madhuranth aka Thevar , in his place. Some of them\n",
      "entertained doubts about the pious prince’ s willingness to become\n",
      "heir. Pazhuvettarayar declared that they would receive\n",
      "Madhuranthakar ’s answer from his own lips, and threw open the\n",
      "palanquin’ s curtains—and the prince himself stepped out! He was\n",
      "very eager to ascend to the throne, too …”\n",
      "“And so, they’re falling all over themselves to crown a warrior\n",
      "who travels in a closed palanquin like a woman? Excellent!\n",
      "Everything aids our plan, I believe—it suits our purposes very well to\n",
      "have unrest among the Chozhas. No one will ever suspect us at any\n",
      "point, will they? You’ve brought great news, Idumbankaari, but tell us\n",

      "come about?”\n",
      "“It was me they placed as a sentry , while they talked among\n",
      "themselves at midnight about their precious royal affairs. I did guard,\n",
      "all right—but I used my eyes and ears as well.”\n",
      "“And did you manage to learn anything more, while you did?”\n",
      "“Yes. Someone else was watching the midnight meeting and\n",

      "morning, I knew that the young master was due to escort his friend\n",
      "to the banks of the Kollidam,  and I crossed his path a few times. My\n",
      "ruse worked— he asked me to accompany him. He stopped on the\n",
      "north bank, but asked me to cross the river and get a horse for his\n",
      "friend. I asked him permission to visit my aunt in Kudandhai—which\n",
      "is how I was able to buy the time to come here.”\n",

      "wondered if he was perhaps, part of our group. He was loitering\n",
      "about on the south bank too, and I believed that he might have been\n",
      "waiting for me. I showed him our secret sign, but he didn’ t recognize\n",
      "it. That was how I understood that he had nothing to do with us—”“You did what ? Ah, what a grievous mistake! You shouldn’t have\n",

      "smithies full of labouring workmen. Thoroughfares thronged with\n",
      "people buying, selling, all hurrying upon important business, and\n",
      "almost choked with bullo ck-carts and horse-drawn chariots.\n",

      "Guards at the entrance were moving people to the sides of the road;\n",

      "up to the sentr ies and demand an explanation—especially  when the\n",
      "rest of the public stood by the side, pliant and subdued. Such a\n",
      "confrontation would only lead to arguments and anger , and there\n",
      "was nothing he wished to avoid more, at this point. His mission was\n",
      "his priority now—not mad bouts with wayfarers or random soldiers.\n",
      "Accordingly , Vandhiyathevan  made himself merge with the\n",
      "people by the roadside—yet , at a vantage point that would enable\n",
      "him to watch the proceedings.\n",
      "The strong scent of flowers assaulted his nose. He turned, and\n",
      "saw a young man holding two full baskets of blooms. Liberally\n",

      "“The Velakkara regiment is in audience with the Emperor now,\n",

      "especially , as a force to recko n with. In name, they were bodyguards\n",

      "And Thanjai was such an attractive city, besides! Newly\n",
      "established, it was beginnin g to expand very quickly , thriving and\n",
      "flourishing with business and people. And with twilight falling as well,\n",
      "hundreds of lamps, lit by the roadside, transformed it into a glittering\n",
      "fairyland.\n",
      "The streets were practically bursting with people; many had\n",
      "arrived from other towns and villages, bent on transacting business\n",
      "and went about looking very important. Most were residents of\n",
      "Chozha Nadu, but Vandhiyathevan’ s keen eyes spotted men who\n",
      "were obvious ly from territories newly brought under Chozha\n",
      "dominions, as well. Travelers had converged here, everywhere from\n",
      "the River Porunai to Paalaaru; from the east to west coast. Why,some had even arrived from north of the Vindhya Mountai ns, or from\n",
      "lands beyond the seas.\n",
      "Customers attached themselves like demented flies to stalls that\n",
      "sold savoury aappams  and sweet adhirasams, buying them in\n",
      "dozens; other shops had bananas and a variety of fruits heaped in\n",
      "little mountains. As for the flower-stalls—those fragrant corners were\n",
      "frankly , beyond description: jasmine, mullai , aathi  and shenbagam\n",
      "flowers rose like little hillocks; women buzzed around them like bees\n",
      "drawn to nectar .\n",
      "Riding past them, Vandhiyathevan remembered the youngster\n",
      "and his baskets of blooms. Ah, an acquaintance with him would have\n",
      "proven convenient indeed; he desperately needed food and lodgings\n",
      "for the night.\n",
      "Even as he thought this, he glimpsed the young man\n",
      "approaching in the distance , and jumped down from his horse at\n",
      "once. “Why , Thambi —you don’t have your baskets with you. What\n",
      "about the blooms? Sold them all?”\n",
      "“Oh, those weren’t for sale. I was taking them to the temple\n",
      "nearby , for the evening’ s worship. I’ve delivered the flowers so I’m on\n",
      "my way home, now .”\n",
      "“And which is the shrine that benefits by your service?”\n",
      "“Have you heard of the Thalikulathaar T emple?”\n",
      "“Ah—would that be the ThanjaiThalikulathaar? I’ve heard much,\n",
      "indeed. And is it a large shrine?”\n",
      "“No, only a small one. But these days, it’s the Durgai Temple that\n",
      "receives all the honours. That’s the one where everyone celebrates\n",
      "all the festivals, offers Pongal and other sacrifices, and generally\n",
      "worships. Even the royal family and the Pazhuvettarayars patronize\n",
      "it. Not so for the Thalikulath aar Temple. In fact, not many people\n",
      "even come there—”“Ah, but you offer it flowers everyday , don’t you? Surely  you’re\n",
      "compensated in some form for your service?”\n",
      "“My family received a grant for the purpose—it was offered to my\n",
      "grandfather during the reign of Emperor Kandaradhith ar. These\n",
      "days, I and my mother serve the temple.”\n",
      "“Is the Thalikulathaar Templ e built of brick? Or stone?” asked\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan. All along the way, he had seen many formerly brick\n",
      "temples freshl y renovated with stone and this divine work had\n",
      "prompted his query .\n",
      "“Brick of cours e, but I’ve heard that they’re going to rebuild  it with\n",
      "stone. At least, they say that Pazhaiyarai city’s PeriyaPiratti wishes\n",
      "to begin work right away , but—” and the youngster hesitated.\n",
      "“But—what?”\n",
      "“What’ s the use of discussing rumours? I’ve heard it said that one\n",
      "must look around before speaking in daylight, and not even that, at\n",
      "night. Besides, we’re surrounded by people, in the midst of a city—”\n",
      "“I would ’ve thought this the best place to discuss secrets. With all\n",
      "the noise and hubbub, no one’ s likely to hear a thing.”\n",
      "“Oh?” The youngster glanced at Vandhiyathevan, suddenly\n",
      "uncertain. “What secrets are we supposed to discuss?”\n",
      "Well, here’s an intelligent young man, mused Vandhiyathevan.\n",
      "This one might prove useful to ferret out information. All the more\n",
      "important that I don’t arouse the worst suspicions in him. Aloud, he\n",
      "spoke in a reassuring voice. “What, indeed? Nothing at all. Be that\n",
      "as it may— Thambi , I’ve traveled far today and desperately need a\n",
      "place to rest for the night. Would you help me please, by suggesting\n",
      "a good inn?”\n",
      "“Thanjai doesn’t lack for accommodation, Ayya. There are a great\n",
      "many chathirams  about, not to mention royal lodgings for foreignvisitors. But if you wish—”\n",
      "“What’ s your name, Thambi ?” asked V andhiyathevan abruptly .\n",
      "“Amudhan; SendhanAmudhan.”\n",
      "“What a beautiful name! As sweet as nectar , to be sure. But you\n",
      "were about to invite me to stay at your own home, weren’t you?”\n",
      "“Yes—but how did you guess?”\n",
      "“I’m a magicia n, Thambi ; I’ve quite a few tricks up my sleeve.\n",
      "Where do you live?”\n",
      "“Our garden is a shout away from the city; we live in a house\n",
      "within.”\n",
      "“That does it; I’m spending the night at your home. I couldn’t get\n",
      "a wink of sleep in this noise and commotion, anyway . In any case, I\n",
      "also wish to make the acqua intance of the gracious lady who bore\n",
      "such a splendid son—your mother .”\n",
      "“She’ s certainly gracious—but also, unfortunate.”\n",
      "“Why do you say so? Perhaps your father—”\n",
      "“My father is no more, it’ s true—but her misfortune dates from her\n",
      "birth. Y ou’ll understand when you see her . Come, now .”\n",
      "Half a naazhigai  beyond the city limits and they arrived at a\n",
      "beautifully tended garden. The heady scent of night-flowers\n",
      "delighted Vandhiyathevan’ s senses, providing unexpected comfort\n",
      "and a sense of well-being. The tumult and roar of the city had\n",
      "receded significantly , and the garden was shrouded in comparative\n",
      "silence. In the middle, stood a tiled cottage. Two thatched huts\n",
      "flanked it, occupied by familie s that assisted Amudhan in tending the\n",
      "garden. The young man tasked a member of one to stable\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan’ s horse and feed it.They entered the house—and as soon as Vandhiyathevan set\n",
      "eyes on Amudhan’ s mothe r, he realized the true extent of her\n",
      "misfortune: the lady was deaf and mute. What she lacke d in these\n",
      "senses though, she more than made up for in others: her face fairly\n",
      "brimmed with compassion and gentleness; her eyes gleamed with\n",
      "the light of intelligence. And is it not one of nature’ s quirks that those\n",
      "who lack a faculty are often blessed more, in others?\n",
      "At Amudhan’ s sign, she understood that their visitor had arrived\n",
      "from foreign parts, and her smiling face revealed her welcoming,\n",
      "hospitable spirit.\n",
      "In a few moments, a dining leaf was duly set on the floor, for the\n",
      "night meal. The first to arrive, as befitting royalty , were fluffy white\n",
      "idiyappams  and coconut-milk; Vandhiyathevan had never , in his life,\n",
      "tasted anything so delightfully  light and sweet. He demolished ten or\n",
      "twelve and half a measure of the milk in short order . Next to make an\n",
      "appearance were thick, savoury tamarind stew and corn-flour cakes;\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan did very well by them as well. Still, his appetite\n",
      "seemed unsated—it took a quarter measure of rice and half a\n",
      "measure of creamy curd to staunch the fire in his belly. Then, and\n",
      "only then did he finally rise from his leaf.\n",
      "He did make good use of the time his meal afforded him, talking\n",
      "to Amudhan. In particular , he was keen on learning of those who\n",
      "dwelt within the Thanjai fort at the moment, aside from\n",
      "SundaraChozhar and his retinue.\n",
      "The Pazhuvettarayar brothers for one, in their various palaces,\n",
      "not to mention their own entourage. The Royal Treasury and\n",
      "Granaries too, which meant that an assorted number of officials and\n",
      "accountants connected to these departments lived in Thanjai. In\n",
      "addition, the Chozha Minister Aniruddha Brahmaraayar , who also\n",
      "happened to be the Emper or’s confidante, had made his home\n",
      "within the fort, as well as the ThirumandhiraOlaiNaayakar , the Royal\n",
      "Scribe. Then too, there were all the guards and soldiers under the\n",
      "command of ChinnaPazhuvettarayar whose warrior duties made it\n",
      "imperative that they and their families reside within the fort. Silverand goldsmiths, precious metal and gemstone merchants had been\n",
      "given places as well. Hundreds of clerks belonging to\n",
      "PeriyaPazhuvettarayar ’s tax department lived there. The Durgai\n",
      "Temple was situated in a corner of the fort; this meant that priests,\n",
      "other menials belonging to the temple and courtesans resided in its\n",
      "vicinity .\n",
      "“And the ministers?” asked Vandhiyathevan, once he had divined\n",
      "all the above information. “Are they all within the fort, as well?”\n",
      "“No, how can that be? They come and go as and when duty\n",
      "demands. Aniruddha Brahmaraayar , for example, hasn’t been in the\n",
      "city for quite some time. They say he has journeyed to the Chera\n",
      "country . PeriyaPazhuvettaray ar left the city four days ago, as well—\n",
      "possibly north of the Kollidam, to the Mid-Lands.”\n",
      "“But perhaps he’ s returned? Or don’t you know?”\n",
      "“I did see the young queen of Pazhuvoor ’s palanquin arrive at the\n",
      "fortress gates this evening, with my very eyes. Not Pazhuvettarayar ,\n",
      "though. Perhaps he stayed somewhere along the way. He might\n",
      "return tomorrow .”\n",
      "“Thambi —Prince Madhuranthakar resides within the fort too,\n",
      "doesn’t he?”\n",
      "“Of course. Next to Pazhuv ettarayar ’s palace, to tell the truth.\n",
      "He’s married to ChinnaPazhuvettarayar ’s daughter , isn’t he?”\n",
      "“Indeed? But this is news to me!”\n",
      "“Not many people know of it. The Emperor ’s health being  what it\n",
      "is, it was decided that wedding celebrations were unwarranted.”\n",
      "“Excellent. In other words, Prince Madhuranthakar is within the\n",
      "fort?”“He must be. I’m not sure, however , as no one is familiar with his\n",
      "whereabouts; he doesn’t venture out, much. Word is that he spends\n",
      "much of his time in worship, meditating upon Siva Peruman and\n",
      "other attendant concerns.”\n",
      "“And yet, he’ s married at such a late date.”\n",
      "“Surprising, but true. And they say the new groom has changed a\n",
      "great deal, after his wedding! But these are royal affairs—far better\n",
      "that we don’t discuss such things.”\n",
      "The urge to pick Amudhan’ s brain and learn more was almost\n",
      "overpowering, but Vandhiyathevan managed to tamp it down. There\n",
      "was no point in asking endless questions and arousing his worst\n",
      "suspicions. After all, one never knew—this naïve youngster might\n",
      "prove to be of immense value, some day. And this charming little\n",
      "cottage so near the city was a great convenience, as well. Why ruin\n",
      "such excellent arrangements?\n",
      "Conspiracies and intrigues aside, the day’s hard travel and the\n",
      "previous night’ s adventures had taken their toll; Vandhiyathevan felt\n",
      "drowsiness creep up upon him. Amudhan noticed that his newfound\n",
      "friend was practically falling asleep where he sat, and swiftly laid out\n",
      "a bed for him.\n",
      "Even as Vandhiyathevan dropped off to slumber , it was the\n",
      "PazhuvoorIlaiya Rani’ s radiant face that he saw. Ah, such an\n",
      "exquisite beauty—a dazzling form and face! He remembered the\n",
      "paralysis that had stolen over him at the sudden sight of the vision of\n",
      "beauty bursting  upon him. Recalling the evening’ s inciden t awoke a\n",
      "vague, long-lost memory .\n",
      "He had been walking along a forest path once, in his childhood,\n",
      "when he had encountered a hissing cobra. Ah, the slender beauty of\n",
      "its form—the sinuous grace of its movements! Vandhiyathevan had\n",
      "not been able to take his eyes off the beautiful creature, not even to\n",
      "blink. The snake wove about, dancing gracefully; his own body\n",
      "mimicked its actions. It is impossible to guess what might havehappened next—but a mongo ose leapt up from nowhere and sprang\n",
      "upon the cobra. The two began a furious battle to the death.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan came out of his trance suddenly , and took to his\n",
      "heels.\n",
      "Chee , what a terrible comparison! How could he ever compare\n",
      "that ravishing beauty with a terrible cobra, in a forest? Why, one look\n",
      "at her fair countenance, radiating innocence, and you could forget\n",
      "hunger , thirst and every other bodily instinct! Well, he was about to\n",
      "meet her again, tomorrow , wasn’t he? Ah, her voice— silky and\n",
      "smooth all at once—he had never heard anything quite like it. But\n",
      "that majestic young woman he had come across on the banks of the\n",
      "Arisilaaru and the Kudandh ai astrologer ’s home— she had been\n",
      "exquisitely lovely as well, not to mention the unearthly beauty in her\n",
      "glowing face! Both were stunning, but ah, how different were their\n",
      "features?\n",
      "Even as he lay dreaming about these two women, a third\n",
      "intruded upon his rumination s, fury radiating in every step. Nithra\n",
      "Devi, that ferocious Goddess who exerted complete and merciless\n",
      "control over the realm of sleep, overwhelmed him swiftly .\n",
      "•24\n",
      "Crows and Nightingales\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan slept like a log all night and woke the next day,\n",
      "well after sunrise. Even at that advanced hour he lay in bed, feeling\n",
      "too lazy to stir. The west winds blew briskly around the cottage;\n",
      "leaves and branches rustled against one another in a low murmur\n",
      "that sounded remarkably like rain. As if in tune to nature’ s music\n",
      "came a sweet voice, singing one of saint Sundaramurthy’ sThevaram\n",
      "hymns, set to a lilting melody:\n",
      "“Ponnaarmeniyanepulith\n",
      "Tholaiaraikasaithu\n",

      "Konraianindhavane!”\n",
      "At this praise to the “golden hued one who wears a tiger’s skin at\n",
      "his waist, and lustrous konrai  flowers in his tresses,” Vandhiyathevan\n",
      "deigned to open his eyes. Sturdy konrai  trees met his sight outside\n",
      "the cottage, with golden yellow blooms hanging off them in long\n",
      "strands. SendhanAmudhan stood underneath, a basket in hand and\n",
      "a hook in another, singing hymns as he plucked them, one by one.\n",
      "The young man had obvious ly bathed very early that morning and\n",
      "now, liberally coated in vibuthi , looke d the very incarnation of\n",
      "Markandeyan. A pity indeed that his mother was fated to never know\n",
      "what a beautiful voice her son possessed!\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan rose with the thought, and felt a strange\n",
      "yearning for the peace and simplicity of a life spent gathering and\n",
      "offering flowers to deities in temples. Why couldn’t he do the same?What was the point in wandering with a sword and spear , looking for\n",
      "someone or something to hunt? Or be hunted, in turn?\n",
      "In a little while , though, his sentiments underwent a change: not\n",
      "everyone was a model citizen like SendhanAmudhan; thieves,\n",
      "murderers, bullies and cheats abounded in this world. And one\n",
      "needed a government to put them in their place. Kings and ministers\n",
      "to form such a government;  Velakkara Regiments to ensure their\n",
      "safety—and men such as himself, if only to go about carrying\n",
      "messages in palm-leaves. Ah yes—he would certainly have to seek\n",
      "an audience with Chakravarthy SundaraChozhar today; should he\n",
      "postpone it, PeriyaPazhuvettarayar would soon return and then he\n",
      "may as well give up any chance of entering the palace …\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan bathed in the lotus pond near the garden,\n",
      "returned to the cottage and dressed in his best clothes and\n",
      "ornaments. To be sure—he was going to see the Emperor himself,\n",
      "wasn’t he? If this was not the perfect opportunity to array himself in\n",
      "fine garments, he didn’t quite know what else was. At least, that was\n",
      "the principal reason. If he had another motive to look his best—such\n",
      "as meeting the PazhuvoorIlaiya Rani, later that day—that was\n",
      "something he kept to himself.\n",
      "Once the morning meal was done, SendhanAmudhanmade\n",
      "preparations to depart for the afternoon’ s worship with his baskets of\n",
      "flowers and V andhiyathevan, for his royal visit. Both started on foot.\n",
      "Vallavarayan had made a decision to leave his horse in the\n",
      "cottage. There  was no point in risking a riot, should he bring it into\n",
      "the fort. Besides, his steed needed the rest; he might have need of it\n",
      "very soon —who knew? It was best that it stayed here.\n",
      "He engaged in some light-hearted banter with Amudhan on their\n",
      "way to the fort, and gleaned a little more information.\n",
      "“Any relations, besides your mother?” he asked.“Yes—her elder sister , and brother . Her sister is no more, but her\n",
      "brother lives in Kodikkarai, and delivers flowers to the Kuzhagar\n",
      "Temple. And he tends to the lighthouse as well. He has a son and\n",
      "daughter . She—” he began, and paused.\n",
      "“What of her?”\n",
      "“Nothing at all. You see, nature has seen fit to bless our family\n",
      "with strange quirks. Some of us are mute, but others possess\n",
      "beautiful voices. They sing extraordinarily well, too …”\n",
      "“Your cousin isn’t mute, is she?” put in V andhiyathevan.\n",
      "“Good heavens, no.”\n",
      "“In other words, she sings very well. Better than you, perhaps?”\n",
      "“Why , what a question—you might as well ask if a nightingale’ s\n",
      "voice is sweeter than a crow ’s! When Poonguzhali begins to sing,\n",
      "the very king of oceans bids his waves fall silent, to listen to her\n",
      "song. Cows, goats and even animals of the forest stay still,\n",
      "spellbound—”\n",
      "“She’ s called Poonguzhali, then? The very essence of a flower ’s\n",
      "fragrance! A beautiful name.”\n",
      "“That’ s not the only thing that’ s beautiful.”\n",
      "“She must be, as well—or you wouldn’t go into such ecstasie s,\n",
      "would you?”\n",
      "“Deer and peacocks are supposed to be the very image of beauty\n",
      "—but even they can’t hope to rival hers; no, not even if they beg and\n",
      "plead for it! And as for Rathi and Indrani, those celestial women will\n",
      "have to do penance for several lifetimes in a vain bid to match her\n",
      "loveliness—”\n",
      "SendhanAmudhan’ s heart was not completely lost at Siva\n",
      "Peruman’ s divine feet, V andhiyathevan noticed.“The perfect bride for you, in fact!” he enthused. “And as she’s\n",
      "your muraippenn , your cousinly claims posse ss even more merit—\n",
      "so, when’ s the wedding?”\n",
      "“I would never dare to call her my equal—it is I who am not in any\n",
      "way worthy of her. If they ever held swayamvarams  for Poonguzhali\n",
      "like in the earlier days, I’m sure kings from all fifty-six  kingdoms\n",
      "would fall over themselves, in a vain bid for her hand! Even the\n",
      "Devas might descend from their celestial abode, perhaps , like they\n",
      "did for Princes s Damayanth i. But then, this is the Kali Yugam, so\n",
      "such things mightn’t happen—”\n",
      "“Well! It almost looks like you wouldn’t want to marry her even if\n",
      "she did.”\n",
      "“Now that would be too much. If Siva Peruman were to appear\n",
      "before me this instant and ask, Do you wish to ascend to Holy\n",

      "consent? Take Pazhuvettarayar , for instance, who’s married at the\n",

      "His magical ring, however , had its effect: the instant he displayed\n",

      "he declared his younger brother Crown Prince, along with the caveat\n",
      "that the latter would succeed his brother on the Chozha throne,\n",
      "when the former ’s rule came to an end.\n",
      "Yet another reason did exist for his conclusion: Kandaradhithar\n",
      "had been married earlier , but his wife had passed away long before\n",
      "he was crowned Emperor; the thought of re-marriage had never\n",
      "entered his heart for many years, after. Brother Arinjayar , however ,\n",

      "Paranthakar , he enjoyed the title Sundaran, one that had been\n",
      "granted lovingl y, by the people themselves. It seemed only natural to\n",
      "Kandaradhithar that such an excellent young man should succeed\n",
      "Arinjayar , after his time. He resolved that such would be the case;\n",
      "ensured that royal court officials such as the Saamantha Kanam ,\n",
      "those associated with the armed forces such as Thandanaayakkas\n",

      "assented to his decision. Accordingly , once the required formalities\n",
      "were fulfilled, he made it known to his subjects as well.\n",
      "And yet—fate played its hand, once these momentous events\n",
      "had happened; a rather strange event occurred in Kandaradhithar ’s\n",
      "life. He chanced to meet, at this late date, the young princess of the\n",
      "Mazhavarayar clan; her beau ty, grace, virtue and deep devotion to\n",

      "and af fection.\n",
      "Neither Emperor not his consort, however , had any mind to\n",
      "change arrangements already made, with regard to the Chozha\n",
      "succession. Both were imme rsed in devotion to Siva Peruman and\n",
      "had no desire for a life of pleasure; they wished to raise their son thesame way. Firm in the belief  that ascension to the magnificent Siva\n",
      "Peruman’ s eternal celestial empire was of far more merit than to a\n",
      "puny , earthly kingdom, they strove to ensure that Madhuranthakan\n",
      "was deserving of a place in a heavenly abode, rather than on the\n",
      "hollow throne ruling a small part of the earth. Kandaradhithar , thus,\n",
      "took great pains to assure those around him, once more, that the\n",
      "Chozha samrajyam  would pass on to Arinjaya and his son after his\n",
      "time, and no one else.\n",
      "Thus it was that the Chozha throne bypassed Rajadithyar who\n",
      "was supposed to have ascended it; Kandaradhithar , who did ascend,\n",
      "but had no great desire to rule—on to Arinjayar and his descendents,\n",
      "who, it seemed, were destined to inherit an empire.\n",
      "Parakesari Arinjayar , however , did not rule the country for an\n",
      "extended perio d of time; not long after Kandaradhithar ascended to\n",
      "Siva’ s celestial abode of Kailasam, his younger brother followed his\n",
      "footsteps to heaven. In accordance with their wishes, the lords,\n",
      "officials and people of Chozha Nadu decided, unanimously , to crown\n",
      "Arinjayar ’s son as the Emperor and so it was done:\n",
      "Rajakesari SundaraChozhar duly ascended the throne and appeared\n",
      "properly cognizant of the great honour and good fortune granted to\n",
      "him. He ruled well, with a firm and just hand; ensured that the lost\n",
      "territories of ThondaiMandalam and Pandiya Nadu were annexed\n",
      "and a part of Chozha domin ions once again, and drove away the\n",
      "Rashtrakuta forces from the shores of the Then Pennai, once and for\n",

      "the forefront without a care for their own lives! Why, he hadn’t heard\n",
      "such tales of daring even in the numerous epics that abounded in\n",
      "the country . Chozha Nadu was fortunate indeed, to be ruled by a\n",
      "dynasty such as this; indeed, so were the other lands under their\n",
      "dominions, at present.\n",
      "Fairly dazzled by these Emperors and their greatness he might\n",
      "have been, but for all that, Vandhiyathevan hadn’t failed  to notice\n",
      "something rather important, about all the portraits: each Chozha had\n",
      "had the Pazhuvoor clan by him, providing extraordinary assistance,\n",
      "aiding in battle and otherwise, to the best and more of their abilities.\n",
      "A Pazhuvettara yar had been the first to lay siege and set foot into\n",
      "the Thanjai fort when it had still been occupied by the Mutharaiyars.\n",
      "When Vijayalayar floundered in the battle of Thiruppurambiyam,\n",
      "having lost both his legs, a Pazhuvoor King hastened to his aid,\n",
      "hoisting the Emperor onto his capable shoulders, his timely support\n",
      "allowing his liege-lord to perform a great many valorous deeds. A\n",
      "Pazhuvoor scion had placed the crown on AdithaChozhar ’s head at\n",
      "his coronation.  And when that Emperor leapt from his elephant to\n",
      "send Aparajitha Varman to his death, a Pazhuvettarayar it was, who\n",
      "had bent down , offering back and shoulders in aid. These sturdy and\n",
      "hardy warriors had been at the forefront of many of Paranthaka\n",
      "Chakravarthy’ s battles, holding aloft the Chozha standard and tiger\n",
      "flag with a proud mien. As Prince Rajadithyar lay mortally  wounded\n",
      "in the battlefi eld, it was a Pazhuvettarayar who gathered thebleeding prince into his lap, delivering the welcome news: “The\n",
      "Rashtrakutas are in retreat!” More of the same staunch, unflinching\n",
      "service had been provided by them to the Emperors Arinjayar and\n",
      "SundaraChozhar as well.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan noted all these and more evidence —quite\n",
      "blatant, at that—of the Pazhuvoor clan’s royal service, and was\n",
      "promptly immersed in speec hless amazement. There was reason\n",
      "enough, it seemed, for the brothers Pazhuvettarayar to exert their\n",
      "authority over all ofChozha Nadu; neither could it be wondered at\n",
      "that SundaraChozhar did not attempt a single decision without their\n",
      "expert advice.\n",
      "What was obvious, on the other hand, was that he,\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan, was in serious dif ficulties at the moment. There was\n",
      "no doubt that ChinnaPazhuvettarayar entertained the gravest\n",
      "suspicions about him, and it was only a matter of time before they\n",
      "were proven right. The truth about the palm-tree signet ring would be\n",
      "out—and then the fat would truly be in the fire! Vallavarayan had\n",
      "heard a great many harrowing tales of Thanjavur ’s gloomy\n",
      "dungeons, under the direct supervision of its Commander . Perhaps\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan would find himself clapped into them—and then he\n",
      "may as well bid farewell to any hope of escape. It was common\n",
      "knowledge that even if anyone did manage to get out alive, it would\n",
      "only be as a blubbering, brainless idiot in skin and bones, wholly\n",
      "devoid of sense!\n",
      "Ah, how was he to escape such a predicament? One thing was\n",
      "certain: he would have to come up with some ruse and leave this city\n",
      "before Pazhuvettarayar the Elder returned.\n",
      "Even the overwhelming desire to meet the young queen of\n",
      "Pazhuvoor had deserted our young hero; all he wanted that very\n",
      "moment, with every fibre of his being, was to flee this city and its\n",
      "terrible dungeo ns, life and limbs intact. He might not have the olai\n",
      "but he could deliver his mess age to KundhavaiPiratti in person—and\n",
      "who cared, frankly , whether she believed him, or didn’t?  How, how\n",
      "was he going to make his way out of this wretched city?Abruptly , he remembered something: what on earth had become\n",
      "of his old cloth es? There could only be one reason for why his new\n",
      "hosts had confiscated those tattered garments, given him rich,\n",
      "dazzling attire,  wined and dined him—check his robes! Of course, it\n",
      "was all obvious now: the olai meant for Kundhavai Devi must have\n",
      "fallen into the Commander ’s hands; no doubt about it. Now he knew\n",
      "why he had grabbed Vandhiyathevan and held his hand so hard,\n",
      "preventing the young man from slipping away with the poets. The\n",
      "reason for the three-man strong escort was clear as well. What he\n",
      "needed now was a ruse—any ruse, to get away from this terrible toil\n",
      "—something, anything, before Pazhuvettarayar returned—think,\n",
      "think—ah, yes! Here was a ruse! No time to waste; to think was to\n",
      "act. He would give it all he had. On guard— Vetrivel ! Veeravel !\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan peeped out of the decorated window of the\n",
      "chithira mandapam . ChinnaPazhuvettarayar approached\n",
      "resplendently on his horse, surrounded by his entourage . Ah, now\n",
      "was the time to carry out his plan; not a moment to pause.\n",
      "The trio playing chokkattaan  up front put a stop to their game and\n",
      "rose; obviously , they had heard their master ’s impending arrival, as\n",
      "well.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan walked up to them. “Beloved brothers, where are\n",
      "my old clothes? Do you know?”\n",
      "“What on earth do you want with those filthy garments?” queried\n",
      "one of the menials. “We’ve obeyed our master ’s instructions and\n",
      "dressed you in new , expensive silks, haven’t we?”\n",
      "“I don’t need these. Do return my old clothes to me soon , and I\n",
      "shall be content.”\n",
      "“We’ve sent them out to be washed. They’ll be returned  to you\n",
      "when they’re done.”\n",
      "“Absolutely not—I need my old garments at once. Thieves, all of\n",
      "you—I’d stashed some mone y in them, and you’ve obviously beentrying to steal it. Return my things at once, or else—!”\n",
      "“Or else what, Thambi ? You’ll chop our heads and pack them off\n",
      "to Thanjavur , will you? But we are in Thanjai now, you know . You’d\n",
      "do well to remember that.”\n",
      "“Adei—will you return my clothes at once, or not?”\n",
      "“Only if they exist, Thambi . You see, we dropped the whole\n",
      "smelly bundle in the river Vettaru. They’d be crocodile feed by now—\n",
      "and whoever heard of getting anything back from a reptile’ s\n",
      "stomach?”\n",
      "“Thieving bastards! So you’re mocking me, are you? Just wait till\n",
      "I report you to your master!” And Vandhiyathevan began to cross the\n",
      "threshold, when one of the men approached at a rapid pace to bar\n",
      "his path. The Vaanar warrior delivered a resounding punch and the\n",
      "man fell on his back, gasping aloud. Blood gushed out of his nose.\n",
      "Another came at Vandhiyathe van, hands outstretched, as though\n",
      "he wished to wrestle him to the ground. Our young man promptly\n",
      "grabbed one of the hands, thrust a leg neatly between both of his\n",
      "opponent’ s limbs and gave a neat twist; the soldier shrieked a pain-\n",
      "filled “Ammaadi !” and sat down with an abrupt thump. By this time,\n",
      "the third was almost on top of Vandhiyathevan; the warrior  turned his\n",
      "legs and aimed  a neat kick at the soldier , who felt the full force of the\n",
      "blow and crashed down with a scream.\n",
      "The three fallen men recovered within moments, rose and circled\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan for another attack—very warily this time,  it must be\n",
      "mentioned.\n",
      "By this time, the sounds of horses clattering up to the entrance of\n",
      "the palace could be heard. Vandhiyathevan saw his chance, set up a\n",
      "loud yell of “Thieves! Thieves!” and fell upon his would-be assailants.\n",
      "The latter tried to restrain him, in vain, while Vandhiyathevan kept up\n",
      "his terrible screeches. “Thieving scoundrels!” he bellowed, again.This seemed to be the cue for ChinnaPazhuvettarayar to enter\n",
      "the scene. “What is the commotion, here?” he demanded.\n",
      "•32\n",
      "An Inquisition\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan ceased to fight the moment he saw\n",
      "ChinnaPazhuvettarayar , and began to walk towards him. His\n",
      "assailants scrambled forward and hung on to him in a bid to stop his\n",
      "progress. The young man cared not a whit and took four steps\n",
      "forward. “Not a moment too soon, Commander! These thieving\n",
      "scoundrels not only stole my clothes, but tried to kill me as well. Ah,\n",
      "is this how you treat your guests? Am I to believe that this is the best\n",
      "example of Thanjai’ s manners and morals? I am, if you please, not a\n",
      "random visitor , but an honoured guest of the Emperor—you did hear\n",
      "Her Majesty’ s words, didn’t you? I’m not quite a nobody  as you’re\n",
      "well aware—I’ m an emissary of the Crown Prince himself. If your\n",
      "wretched men could treat me, a royal messenger thus, what might\n",
      "be the fate of ordinary mortals? Frankly , my lord, I’m surprised you\n",
      "have such rascals in your service. We wouldn’t even let such men\n",
      "cross our thresholds, in Thon daiMandalam—we’d sentence them to\n",
      "death on a sharp kazhumaram , first!” And Vandhiyathevan paused to\n",
      "take a breath, after his breathless exposition.\n",
      "As for ChinnaP azhuvettarayar … he had not quite recovered, yet,\n",
      "from Vallavarayan’ s almost effortless handling of the three stocky\n",
      "men who had attempted to strangle him; visions of his martial\n",
      "prowess still clouded his memory . Ah, a warrior such as this would\n",
      "be a shining ornament to his own regiment! He must  get this young\n",
      "man to join his ranks, some how. “Patience, Thambi , patience,” he\n",
      "soothed, voice practically dripping with tranquility and goodwill. “I find\n",
      "it rathe r difficult to believe that my men could have been quite so\n",
      "stupid.  I shall make enquires, shall I?”“That, precisely , is my desire as well, Commander . Interrogate\n",
      "them thoroughly , my lord, and deliver me justice,” shot back\n",
      "Vallavarayan. “Not to mention my clothes and valuables as well.”\n",
      "“Adei, you idiots—leave that lad alone, for a moment. What were\n",
      "my instructions  to you, and what is it that you have accomplished,\n",
      "now?” chided ChinnaPazhuvettarayar . “Why on earth did you lay\n",
      "hands on him?”\n",
      "“We carried out every word of your command, Yejamaan : we\n",
      "escorted this young man here, treated him to a luxuriou s oil-bath,\n",
      "new clothes, dazzling orname nts, and a meal fit for a king. Then, we\n",
      "brought him to the chithira mandapam . He spent some time gazing\n",
      "at the portraits—and then, suddenly , came to us, asking for his old\n",
      "clothes,” explained a man. “And then he practically pounced on us!”\n",
      "“But you—three bulky men—could not handle that boy’s blows,\n",
      "could you?” ChinnaPazhuve ttarayar ’s hard eyes glowed  blood-red\n",
      "with rage and mortification.\n",
      "“If we hesitated, Master , it was only because he was a royal\n",
      "guest. Give us leave now , and we’ll tear him into pieces—”\n",
      "“Enough of these tall tales, idiots! Well, Thambi ? What about\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "“Give them the leave they ask for, I say. And give me leave as\n",
      "well, Commander . It’s been quite a while since I grappled with\n",
      "Chozha  foes; my shoulders practically ache for the exerc ise. I’d be\n",
      "delighted to teach them a lesson on perfect behaviour towards royal\n",
      "guests!”\n",
      "“Admirable, my boy,” ChinnaPazhuvettarayar smiled a little. “But\n",
      "you would do well to reserv e your teaching instincts for genuine\n",
      "Chozha traitors. The Chakra varthy is ill, after all, and orders are to\n",
      "allow no dispu tes or altercations of any kind within the fort, that his\n",
      "peace might be undisturbed.”“In that case, kindly ask these men to return my garments and\n",
      "belongings at once.”\n",
      "“Where are they , you three?”\n",
      "“Master , we have kept them safe, as per your orders.”\n",
      "“Ah, how they lie, these immo ral idiots, Commander—and right to\n",
      "your face as well! A few moments ago, they swore that my clothes\n",
      "had been delivered to be washed, and now they declar e they are\n",
      "“kept safe,” as per your instructions,” exploded Vandhiyathevan.\n",

      "uselessly at the best of times. But why do you care so much about\n",

      "them?”\n",
      "“A few gold coins for my journey , yes—” before Vandhiyathevan\n",
      "could continue, ChinnaPazhuvettarayar cut in. “Those would be of\n",

      "“I’m Crown Prince AdithaKar ikalar ’s envoy , Commander . I’m not\n",

      "your possession, did you?”\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan spent a moment in thought;\n",

      "you are, and to whom you address these words. I shall ignore your\n",
      "heated retorts for the sake of your youth. But what was this precious\n",

      "“I’m afraid I can’t reveal that, Commander . It’s rather confidential.”\n",

      "the defeat, in this cunning war of words. He had traded barbs with\n",
      "this lad, hoping to catch him out in a lie—but all that had happened\n",
      "was that the Commander of Thanjai had been forced to pacify\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan, supplying halting explanations to assuag e the boy’s\n",

      "precious jewels parading in a wedding procession.\n",
      "“Here are your clothes, Thambi ,” waved ChinnaPazhuvettarayar .\n",
      "“Do inspect them to see if everything as it should be.”\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan took the Commander at his word and duly\n",

      "that it containe d a great many more gold coins than befor e. The olai\n",
      "meant for Kundhavai Devi was within, as well. But how on earth did\n",
      "so much gold find its way in here? And how had the olai, missing thefirst time, suddenly re-appeared? Well, there was only one\n",
      "explanation; it must have fallen into the clutches of\n",
      "ChinnaPazhuvettarayar , who had stuffed it in just now, post\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan’ s persistent questions. I wonder why, mused the\n",
      "young man. And why is there so much more gold than I need? Ah,\n",
      "he’s a wily one, Thanjai’ s Commander . There was more to this than\n",
      "met the eye, and Vandhiyathevan wondered just how much more\n",
      "ChinnaPazhuvettarayar would put him through, before he was done.\n",
      "There was no doubt that he would have to be very careful indeed\n",
      "and never let his guard down for a single moment.\n",
      "“Everything is to your satisfaction, Thambi ?” enquired the\n",
      "Commander , solicitously . “Gold and precious belongings included?”\n",
      "“In a moment, my lord,” Vandhiyathevan replied and began\n",
      "counting the gold coins. He piled the excess number in a heap, and\n",
      "pushed them away . “Comman der, I’m a scion of the Vaanar dynasty;\n",
      "a messenger of the peerless warrior AdithaKarikalar . I neither crave\n",
      "nor need anything that isn’t mine.”\n",
      "“Your honesty is to be comm ended, but I rather think you may\n",

      "Elder?”\n",

      "happy to show you around. A word of warning, thoug h: do not\n",
      "venture outside  the fort, for the gates will be closed at sunset, and\n",
      "you will not be able to return , no matter how hard you try. You are\n",
      "free, however , to wander where you will, within the city.” And\n",
      "ChinnaPazhuvettarayar called forward two of his henchmen,\n",
      "murmuring something into their ears.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan, watching, him, did not find it very difficult to\n",
      "guess what the whispered message might have been.\n",
      "•33\n",
      "A Maid in a Tree!\n",
      "With two of ChinnaPazhuvettarayar ’s men flanking him on either\n",
      "side, Vandhiyathevan set off in state, on his grand tour of the city of\n",
      "Thanjavur . That his escorts were to prevent his escape was obvious;\n",
      "equally evident was the fact that the sentries at the fortress gates\n",
      "had received orders to not let anyone leave the city, that day.\n",
      "Nevertheless, Vandhiyathevan determined to do so before midnight\n",
      "—he would have to, if he wished to slip out of the terrible fate of\n",
      "meeting Periya Pazhuvettarayar . Lingering any more would reduce\n",
      "his chances of escape considerably—nay , his very hope of staying\n",
      "alive!\n",
      "His mind came  up with a variety of strategies to make his way\n",
      "out, even as he wandered along one street after another , gazing at\n",
      "the sights. The first order of the day was to slip from the clutches of\n",
      "his two demon -like guards and then, from the fort—but how on earth\n",
      "was he to manage it? For the life of him, he could not evolve a\n",
      "suitable plan that would answer all his purposes.\n",
      "To tell the truth, it wouldn’t present a great deal of difficulty to\n",
      "overpower these men; he could flip them over his shou lder in an\n",
      "instant and slither into the crowds—but where ? It was common\n",
      "knowledge that the Pazhuve ttarayar brothers had streng thened the\n",
      "Thanjavur fort beyond belief; people were prone to say that not even\n",
      "a breez e could enter its confi nes without their permission. Why, even\n",
      "the Emperor had mentioned, this morning, that Yama himself quaked\n",
      "with fear abou t breaching its borders. How was he, a lone man, to\n",
      "manage it, then? All he had to do was lay a finger on his guards and\n",
      "they would set up a yell that would banish him straight to the city’s\n",
      "dungeons. That, or he would  lose his life in an instant. No, attacking\n",
      "his sentries was not the solution; he would have to strategize his\n",
      "escape; first from these men,  and then, from this blasted city. Well—no fort worth the name had ever existed without a secret passage of\n",
      "some kind, had it? The stron ger the fortress, in fact, the more the\n",
      "chances of a secret passage, somewhere. But how was he to\n",
      "discover it? Who would possess information of that kind? More\n",
      "importantly , even if they did, would they ever divulge it to him?\n",
      "Even as he walked along, revolving and discarding one scheme\n",
      "after another , his mind recalle d the young queen of Pazhu voor. Ah, if\n",
      "there was anyone in this wretched stronghold who might extend a\n",
      "helping hand, it would have to be that gracious lady. Admittedly , this\n",
      "was a bit of a stretch, but he could use Azhwarkkadiyaan’ s name to\n",
      "get into her good graces. Things should proceed quite easily after\n",
      "that—but he would have to find PeriyaPazhuvettarayar ’s palace first,\n",
      "to make headway along this circuitous route. And even then, he\n",
      "would have to give the slip to these men, who mustn’t suspect his\n",
      "intentions of visiting the Ilaiya Rani. If they did, they would march\n",
      "straight to ChinnaPazhuvettarayar with the news, and that would\n",
      "truly be the end of it all. But oh, here was another terrible thought:\n",
      "what if PeriyaPazhuvettara yar himself arrived home as he,\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan, was in his palace? He would not only be guilty of\n",
      "entering a ferocious lion’s den, but sticking his head into its mouth as\n",
      "well.\n",
      "Seemingly immersed he might have been in the city’s sights, but\n",
      "for all that, Vandhiyathevan had not failed to make use of his eyes\n",
      "and mouth; questions poured  out of his lips in an unending stream.\n",
      "“What’ s that?”—“And this?”—“Whose palace is that?”—“What’ s this\n",
      "building?”—“Is that a gopuram ?”—“What about this mansion?” His\n",
      "ears pricked up every time, wondering if he would get “This is\n",
      "PeriyaPazhuvettarayar ’s palace,” or “This is the PazhuvoorIlaiya\n",
      "Rani’ s mansion,” for a reply . His eyes swung in all four directions,\n",
      "eager to take in anything and everything. And as they did, one thing\n",
      "entered his sight and affixed itself in his brain very well: Thanjai\n",
      "might possess wide avenues thronging with people and vehicles—\n",
      "but it also accommodated a great many tiny alleys, little alcoves,\n",
      "nooks and crannies, not to mention gardens thick with leafy trees. It\n",
      "would not be terribly difficult, Vandhiyathevan mused, to dart into oneof those little lanes, scramble up a tree and hide inside some\n",
      "sprawling estate. It would even be possible to stay conce aled for a\n",
      "day or two—but what was important was to make an escape without\n",
      "anyone noticin g, and to ensu re that no one looked for him. Either of\n",
      "which would certainly prove impossible if ChinnaPazhu vettarayar\n",
      "sent out a swarm of his seemingly endless supply of soldiers, to\n",
      "conduct a search.\n",
      "Or Vandhiyathevan had another option: beg for asylum at\n",
      "someone’ s home. And who else but the Ilaiya Rani would take pity\n",
      "on him, in this vast Thanjai city? He’d simply have to use all the\n",
      "powers of his considerable imagination and spin a story so fantastic\n",
      "that she’d have no choice but to believe him. And the first step\n",
      "towards accom plishing all this would be to escape the clutches of his\n",
      "guards—\n",
      "Ah, what’ s this commotion? Who’ s shouting? Who are these\n",
      "people and why are they going about in such crowds? Thanks be to\n",
      "God— there’ s no doubt You are on my side, this instant! For I can\n",
      "see a way—here’ s the ruse I need, the perfect tool to make my\n",
      "escape —!\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan had just arrived at a junction in one of the many\n",
      "lanes that cut through a large avenue, and stumbled upon the sight\n",
      "of a large crowd passing by, chanting in victorious voices that\n",
      "pierced the heavens, clashing  cymbals and other instruments. It was\n",
      "easy to see that this was the Velakkara Regiment, on their way out\n",
      "of the fort after an audience with the Emperor . What if he simply\n",
      "blended in with them—ah, surely there couldn’t be a better way to\n",
      "effect his escape?\n",
      "He was quite sure that his persistent escorts would certainly\n",
      "never let him get away quite so easily; they would pursue him even\n",
      "through the chaotic regiment. And it would be no easy matter to slip\n",
      "through the imposing gates,  either; surely no sentry worth the title\n",
      "would be quite  so stupid as to let him just walk away? They would\n",
      "stop him— but on the other hand, what other choice did he have? Hewould have to be a fool indee d, to ignore this godsent opportunity to\n",
      "make his way out.\n",
      "He turned, as usual, to the guards by him, asking who the\n",
      "passing men were and what they did here. Once he received the\n",
      "answer that “they were the V elakkara Regiment,” he began plying his\n",
      "escorts with questions. He wished, he prattled on, to join this brave\n",
      "band of soldiers, and wanted  to approach them, see them at close\n",
      "quarters—and began inching his way towards the noisy clan. A little\n",
      "later, he exclai med, airily, that he wished very much to see the men\n",
      "who played the thaarai  and thappattai  instruments at the front—and\n",
      "promptly mingled with the crowd.\n",
      "Even as the regiment moved forward, Vandhiyathevan shifted\n",
      "with them, going forwards and backwards, this side and that, yelling\n",
      "victorious chants in an enthusiastic voice that threatened to drown\n",
      "out even the Velakkara soldiers. Some of the latter stared hard at\n",
      "him, wondering  at his identity; some pegged him for an idiot, excited\n",
      "at the sight of a crowd; other s looked amused, obviously thinking he\n",
      "had indulged in spirits just a little too much. No one, however , tried to\n",
      "stop him, or push him away .\n",
      "His escorts stayed by the sidelines, frankly nervous about mixing\n",
      "with the boisterous crowd. Somehow , he was sure to step out,\n",
      "somewhere, they consoled themselves, and assuaged their\n",
      "conscience by standing aside, peeping through the crowds\n",
      "occasionally .\n",
      "At that mome nt, a young woman carrying a basket of curds,\n",
      "paused by an alley, to allow the Regiment to pass. One of the\n",
      "soldiers minced up to her. “I am very thirsty , Amma—may I have\n",
      "some curd?”\n",
      "“Not curds,” that young lady, not to be outdone, spat a retort. “But\n",
      "I can certainly deliver two sound slaps to your cheek!”\n",
      "“Will you, now?” shot back the soldier . “Then you may as well\n",
      "give me those!” He stepped closer to the young woman who shiedaway and sudd enly, took to her heels. The soldier set off in pursuit;\n",
      "two more men broke away from the regiment, haring after their mate.\n",
      "As every one of the runners began to set up shouts and yells, darting\n",
      "here and there, no one quite  knew what the commotion was about;\n",
      "only that there was a great deal of entertainment involved.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan, watching all this, came to a sudden decision. As\n",
      "we have seen quite a few times before, to think was to act for our\n",
      "young man; the word hesitati on had no place in his adventurous life.\n",
      "And once he had come to conclusion, to pause and reflect was alien\n",
      "to his very nature. Accordingly , he acted.\n",
      "“Run! Run!” he shrieked, and took off after the soldiers in pursuit\n",
      "of the young curd-seller . “Catch her! Get her!” The lass ran for a\n",
      "while, and into a narrow alley—but when her pursuers entered it,\n",
      "panting, they could see nothing of her. She had vanished! The\n",
      "soldiers, however , seemed to have decided that enough was\n",
      "enough; they gave up their sport and returned to their own.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan, however , did not.\n",
      "He ran for a while along the curd-seller ’s lane and scurried\n",
      "around two or three more corners. Then, and only then did he\n",
      "slacken his pace somewhat, and fall to a walk.\n",
      "We know, don’t we, that the Velakkara Regiment usually left the\n",
      "fort at sunset? The day ended earlier in the little lanes\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan walked through; they were already shrouded in\n",
      "darkness. Sometimes, he strode along streets with stone walls or\n",
      "madhil s towe ring on either side; at others, just a simple fence,\n",
      "interspersed with foliage. No matter; Vandhiyathevan did not stop for\n",
      "an instant, uncaring of his direction. Small lanes and alleys, no\n",
      "matter how circuitous, would have to end in the outer fort walls at\n",
      "some point. He would decide his next course of action once he had\n",
      "reached his destination. He had the whole night to think up a dozen\n",
      "different ruses, didn’t he?Night fell completely , in a while—and Vandhiyathevan’ s path did\n",
      "end in a fort wall. In fact, he knew that he had reached an impasse in\n",
      "his journey only when he butted, slightly , against solid stone, in the\n",
      "thick of the night.\n",
      "He could not really guess, however , at its height or other\n",
      "dimensions; for all he knew , it may well be the outer fort-wall itself. In\n",
      "which case, the best option at the moment was to squat at its base.\n",
      "The moon would rise soon, and he would know more in its pearly\n",
      "light. Certainly , no better place could be found to hide away in this\n",
      "sprawling city. His erstwhile escorts would have returned to\n",
      "ChinnaPazhuvettarayar by now and delivered the news; the\n",
      "Commander would have sent his men out, at once, in pursuit. He\n",
      "might even have suspected Vandhiyathevan of having made his\n",
      "escape with the Velakkara Regiment; it was certain that soldiers\n",
      "would be wandering the thoroughfares, looking for him both within\n",
      "the city and without. Let them tear their collective hairs out, by all\n",
      "means. Let them search for him endlessly and embrace defeat. I\n",
      "shall dupe them all and make my escape out of this fort right under\n",
      "their very stupid noses, or my name isn’t Vandhiyathevan —nor am I\n",
      "a scion of the famed V aanar clan!\n",
      "Moonrise would, however , present difficulties for him too;\n",
      "Pazhuvettarayar ’s soldiers would find the light an ally, as well. They\n",
      "might even run him to earth here—ha, much good that would do\n",
      "them. Not a whisper of Vandhiyathevan would they find here, if their\n",
      "quarry chose to hide within these dense groves!\n",
      "He leant back against the stone wall and slid down, to sit on the\n",
      "ground. Running around endlessly all day, the strenuous exercise\n",
      "and his own youth conspir ed to make him drowsy; his eyelids\n",
      "drooped. The west wind stirred the trees nearby; branches rustled\n",
      "against one another , soothing him with a pleasant, shushing lullaby\n",
      "that calmed his senses. V andhiyathevan fell asleep.\n",
      "By the time he awoke, the moon had risen and climbed a little, up\n",
      "the eastern sky. Pale light dappled the ground amidst tree branches\n",
      "and leaves, and Vandhiyathe van managed to take in a little of hissurroundings. He remembered the day’s events, took stock of\n",
      "himself, and was frankly astonished that he had actually managed to\n",
      "fall asleep under such circumstances. Even more amazing, however ,\n",
      "was the reason for his awak ening. What exactly had roused him?\n",
      "Hadn’t it seemed like a voice?  Human? Or an animal’ s? A night-\n",
      "bird’s call, perhaps? Had he, in fact, heard a voice?\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan craned his neck and peered above, to gaze at\n",
      "the wall towerin g over him in the patchy moonlight. This, he decided,\n",
      "could not really be the fort madhil ; those were usually much, much\n",
      "higher . Was there, perhaps, a smaller wall within a large r one? Or\n",
      "was this the outer wall of some sort of palace’ s garden?\n",
      "Still craning his neck, Vandhiyathevan rose—and his heart\n",
      "skipped several beats. His intestines seemed to uncoil themselves\n",
      "and climb up, choking his throat. Sheer terror stifled him for a\n",
      "moment. There, on a branch above the wall— what  on earth was it?\n",
      "Memories of every single tale of vedhaalams , apparitions that\n",
      "haunted trees, flooded his mind.\n",
      "But—could ghosts speak in a human voice? A young woman’ s\n",
      "too? This particular spirit seemed to possess such capabilities, at\n",
      "any rate. Vandhiyathevan decided that he would listen carefully ,\n",
      "before he came to unjust conclusions.\n",
      "“Well, Ayya? Did you fall asleep again st the wall? How many\n",
      "more times am I supposed to call out to you?”\n",
      "Ha—not a misplaced apparit ion haunting trees; this truly was a\n",
      "young human woman, talking from a branch. Was all this a fantastic\n",
      "dream? Surely such things didn’t happen in real life!\n",
      "“Of all the ridiculous—! You still look half-asleep. Here, I’m\n",
      "sending down a ladder . Climb  up carefully , will you? I don’t want you\n",
      "slipping and breaking your neck.”\n",
      "And the lass pulled up a slender bamboo contraption from her\n",
      "side and pushed it outside, leaning it against the wall.None of this made any sense to Vandhiyathevan, of cours e—but\n",
      "when had he ever refused to make use of a godsent opportunity , a\n",
      "rare chance that practically of fered itself to him, thus?\n",
      "What must happen would happen; he would deal with anything\n",
      "that fate threw at him. Climbing up the ladder was the priority , now.\n",
      "As to what came after—he would confront it when he reached the\n",
      "top of the wall.\n",
      "He had climbed almost three-quarters up, when the young\n",
      "woman spoke again. “I never knew anyone for being so late. There’ s\n",
      "the Ilaiya Rani, the young queen, waiting endlessly—and here you\n",
      "are, snoring against the palace wall!”\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan almost fell off the ladder in shock. Fortunately ,\n",
      "he grabbed hold of a random  stone that jutted out of the wall and\n",
      "managed to right himself in the nick of time.\n",
      "The Ilaiya Rani! Surely it couldn’t mean—yet, who else could it\n",
      "be, but the young queen of Pazhuvoor? How on earth could she\n",
      "have possibly known that he, Vandhiyathevan, was squa tting at the\n",
      "bottom of her wall? Truly, she must possess some sort of magic that\n",
      "allowed her to see such things! She certainly did seem intensely\n",
      "interested in meeting him, didn’t she? But stay—perhaps —perhaps\n",
      "he had climbed up a ladder meant for another?\n",
      "No matter . Vandhiyathevan had stepped forward; there was no\n",
      "going back. He would see this right to the end—and that wouldn’t be\n",
      "too long, now .\n",
      "He approache d the top and the young woman put out a hand,\n",
      "pulling him up. Moonlight bathed her face—but by this time,\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan had lost all capability of feeling any surprise\n",
      "whatsoever . How else could he have not fallen off the wall, even\n",
      "after seeing that this lass was none other than the young curd-seller ,\n",
      "pursued so hotly by the Velakkara Regiment that very evening?\n",
      "Truth be told, nothing, no matter how peculiar , would amaze him\n",
      "anymore tonight.“Come—are you going to squat on that wall and gape forever?\n",
      "Pull the ladder in and climb  down, quick!” And the young woman\n",
      "slipped down the tree swiftly .\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan obeyed. He had landed, it seemed, in some sort\n",
      "of elaborate garden. In the distance rose a large palace’ s many\n",
      "gopurams , gables and towers, shimmering in the pearly moonlight\n",
      "like something out of a fairyland.\n",
      "He cleared his throat, intending to ask whose this was—when he\n",
      "was silenced by a peremptory “Hush!” from the young woman, who\n",
      "signed him to silence with a finger on her lips, and walked forward.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan gave in, and followed her .\n",
      "•34\n",
      "The Latha Mandapam\n",
      "The young woman walked swiftly along a narrow path that\n",
      "meandered through an almost impenetrable mango-grove, and\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan followed her swiftly . No easy task, this; so dense\n",
      "was the foliage, the luxuriou s growth of bushes that he stumbled\n",
      "often. Once, when he hesita ted, having almost run into a tree, the\n",
      "lass turned back to stare at him. “What are you dawdling  there for?\n",
      "Surely you haven’t forgotten  the way? You’ve eyes that can pierce\n",
      "the darkness, haven’t you?”\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan simply brought a finger to his lips and returned\n",
      "her own answer: “Hush!”\n",
      "Scrabbling noises and muffled commotion outside the palace\n",
      "walls reached them at that moment—it sounded like men scuffling\n",
      "about.\n",
      "Man and girl walked on a little distance. A few momen ts later,\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan gave a low chuckle.\n",
      "The young woman turned and raised an eyebrow . “See anything\n",
      "that amuses you?”\n",
      "“Nothing I see—only what I can hear .”\n",
      "“And that would be—?”\n",
      "“Don’t tell me you didn’t hear the footsteps of those who were\n",
      "pursuing me, hotfoot. I could n’t help laughing at the thought of their\n",
      "intense disappointment.”\n",
      "She looked suddenly fearful. “Someone’ s pursuing you? But\n",
      "why?”“Why else did you think I was squatting at the bottom of a wall,\n",
      "bumbling about like a sightless loon?”\n",
      "The wind rustled through the trees, unsettling heaving branches;\n",
      "a stray ray of moonlight fell on Vandhiyathevan’ s feature s. The girl\n",
      "gaped at him, face wreathed in perplexion.\n",
      "“What on earth are you staring at?” he queried.\n",
      "“I was wondering if you were, well— you.”\n",
      "“If I weren’t I, who else would I be?”\n",
      "“Well, you had a large mous tache the last time you came, didn’t\n",
      "you?”\n",
      "“But how intelligent, my girl. A man like me, who makes his living\n",
      "climbing on and off walls at night—do you really think I could survive\n",
      "without a disguise to suit every occasion?”\n",
      "“And you look, well—younger , too.”\n",
      "“As to that, a man in good spirits always drinks from the fountain\n",
      "of youth.”\n",
      "“You’re in good spirits? Why?”\n",
      "“The gracious  and bountiful condescension of your beautiful\n",
      "Maharani would ensure the happiness of anyone.”\n",
      "“Don’t you dare mock her. She may be the young queen now, but\n",
      "there’ s no doubt that she will become a Maharani, someday .”\n",
      "“My sentiments, exactly .”\n",
      "“Ha, you agree , do you? And what’ s to stop you from arguing that\n",
      "she became one only becau se of your magic and tricks? Why, you\n",
      "wouldn’t even hesitate to demand half the empire from her!”By this time, Vandhiyathevan had learnt a good deal of what he\n",
      "intended and stayed silent, choosing to spend his time, instead, in\n",
      "furious thought.\n",
      "Who, he wondered, was he really about to meet? The young\n",
      "queen of Pazhuvoor? Equally , it could be ChinnaPazhuv ettarayar ’s\n",
      "daughter , who had lately married Madhuranthaka Thevar . His escort\n",
      "was leading him towards the palace, obviously under the firm belief\n",
      "that he was some sort of magician and now, he was about to meet\n",
      "this mysterious  “Ilaiya Rani”—but how on earth was he to conduct\n",
      "himself in her presence? Ah, be still, my beating heart! As long as\n",
      "you retain your courage, there’s still hope. After all, there would be\n",
      "no dearth of clever ruses he could use, to make his escape—his\n",
      "brain had never failed to help him out of precarious situations. Why\n",
      "on earth would it betray him now , especially against a woman?\n",
      "They approached a large palace, but went neither to its front\n",
      "entrance, nor the back. Instead, they seemed to be making straight\n",
      "for an appendage that jutted out from the building proper—a\n",
      "sensual, beautifully carved and decorated latha mandapam , in fact.\n",
      "On closer inspection, it became clear that this artfully embellished\n",
      "gallery was actually built as a passageway that connected two\n",
      "enormous palaces, both of which seemed to be markedly different:\n",
      "the one on the right shimmered against the night sky, lit with glowing\n",
      "lamps, filled with the echoes of human voices and sounds of\n",
      "occupation. The palace to the left, however , had not a single lit lamp,\n",
      "even a tiny one. Its walls rose to the sky, pale in the moonlight, but it\n",
      "remained shrouded in silence and darkness.\n",
      "Once they were at the latha mandapam , the girl signed to\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan to stay where he was. It was only when he obeyed,\n",
      "that the young man drew a deep breath—and promptly took in the\n",
      "presence of flowers around him. Such fragrance—such a deep,\n",
      "overwhelming scent! Why, they wreathed around him, rose to his\n",
      "very brain and almost overpowered him with their heady perfume!\n",
      "The young woman entered the gallery and obviously engaged in\n",
      "conversation—for a sweet, feminine voice immediately joined hers.“Do you even need to ask? Show him in at once; I’ve been waiting\n",
      "an age!”\n",
      "That voice—it wound intoxicating tendrils through his senses and\n",
      "turned him giddy with pleasu rable anticipation. The PazhuvoorIlaiya\n",
      "Rani, no doubt. In an instant,  he would be in front of her; how was he\n",
      "to handle the situation? And she—what would her reactio n be, once\n",
      "she saw that the man who stood in front of her was not the magician\n",
      "she awaited, but the one who had rammed into her palanquin?\n",
      "Would she be taken aback with surprise? Perhaps she would be\n",
      "delighted? Or—or would she choose not to reveal any emotion?\n",
      "But stay—here  was his young guide, back at the entrance to the\n",
      "latha mandapam . She was gesturing for him to enter .\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan walked to where she stood, and peered within\n",
      "the gallery . In an instant, the scene entered his brain through his\n",
      "eyes, and seared itself into his memory .\n",
      "A lamp glowed bright, affixed to a stand of burnishe d gold,\n",
      "sending its rich, vivid radiance into all corners of the gallery . Some\n",
      "sort of incense  had obviously been blended with the oil; a sweet\n",
      "fragrance threa ded its way throughout. An ornate saprakooda  couch\n",
      "stood, strewn with fragrant flowers; on it reclined a young lady,\n",
      "majesty and grace limning every part of her .\n",
      "It was indeed, the young queen of Pazhuvoor .\n",
      "If she had seemed lovely in the stark light of day, within her\n",
      "palanquin—she appeared to be the epitome of exquisite  beauty at\n",
      "night, a very Goddess come down to earth in her divine glory, seated\n",
      "on her couch, her stunning profile thrown into relief in the golden\n",
      "radiance of a lamp.\n",
      "Said lamp’ s dazzling light; the gently soothing incense; the\n",
      "PazhuvoorIlaiya Rani’ s striking beauty—all these serve d to send\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan off-kilter , his senses reeling, brain fuzzy with the\n",
      "sheer magnificence of it all.Careful, Vandhiyatheva! You dared to touch liquor only once —but\n",
      "you still remember , don’t you, the terrible power it had over your\n",
      "faculties? The way it rendered you senseless, weak and inebriated?\n",
      "You swore never to touch a drop again. Remember your pledge —\n",
      "and steel yourself. Do not succumb to this intoxication, far, far more\n",
      "powerful than those of spirits!\n",
      "Nandhini, young queen of Pazhuvoor , gazed at him, her soft\n",
      "coral-red lips parted a little in surprise, revealing pearly white teeth.\n",
      "Her temporary  speechlessne ss served to assist Vandhiyathevan’ s\n",
      "cause, to tell the truth.\n",
      "He laughed gently , and gazed back at her. “My lady, your maid\n",
      "entertained the strangest suspicions about me—she wanted to know\n",
      "if I was a magician, or not. And how do you think she chose to\n",
      "address it? She turned to me and asked, Are you, you?” He\n",
      "chuckled again.\n",
      "Nandhini smiled. A flash of lightning dazzled Vandhiyath evan’ s\n",
      "vision; a sweet shower of honey seemed to drench him.\n",
      "“She’ s certainl y prone to a variety of strange fancies, I’m afraid.\n",
      "Vasuki, why do you still stand  here like a tree? Return to your place\n",
      "—and if you hear the slightest footstep, slam the door closed.”\n",
      "“As you wish, Amma .” And Vasuki retired, walking along a\n",
      "pathway that led within the latha mandapam  towards the brightly lit\n",
      "palace; reached her place by the dimly lit entrance, and sat down.\n",
      "Nandhini lowered her voice a little. “She didn’t quite believe that\n",
      "you were a magician, you say? Silly little fool. More than half the\n",
      "ones who call themselves so are deceivers, I tell you. But you—you\n",
      "truly are one. What sort of spell did you weave to suddenly spring up\n",
      "here?”\n",
      "“Nothing quite so dramatic, my lady. All I did was climb a ladder\n",
      "by the wall.”“That, is quite obvio us—what I meant was, what sort of charm did\n",
      "you use to fool this young woman?”\n",
      "“I turned on the full force of my charismatic smile on her, under\n",
      "the light of the beautiful moon . Failing that, I was hoping to show her\n",
      "the palm-tree signet ring you kindly bestowed upon me.”\n",
      "“So you do have it safe? Surely you could have just walked\n",
      "through the front entrance in broad daylight? Why skulk around in\n",
      "this stifling darkness?”\n",
      "“If you wouldn’t think it amiss, my lady, I should like to inform you\n",
      "that your broth er-in-law ChinnaPazhuvettarayar ’s men are thieving\n",
      "rascals. First, they tried to make away with my clothes and\n",
      "belongings; next, they followed me around the city without leaving\n",
      "my side an instant. Ah, the devious ruses I had to employ , just to slip\n",
      "their nets of surveillance! I managed to escape, run through all the\n",
      "alleys and by-lanes I could  think of, wriggle through nooks and\n",
      "crannies and finally made my way to your palace, wandering all\n",
      "around it. That’ s when I clapped my eyes on the ladder against the\n",

      "I, on the other hand, possess not the slightest bit of influence. How\n",

      "Wondering if these words were heartfelt or mere lip-service paid\n",
      "by a talented courtier , Nandhini trained the power of her lovely eyes\n",

      "Vandhiyathevan gazed right back at her , not fazed in the least.\n",

      "another lady. If she refuses my services for some reason, then I shallbe delighted to of fer them to you.”\n",

      "that it can’t make any difference if you do, as well.” And\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan proffered the palm-leaf AdithaKarikalan had written\n",
      "to Kundhavai.\n",
      "Nandhini took the olai, held it under the lamp and read the\n",
      "contents without a word. As she finished, eyes flashing lightning shot\n",
      "sparks of sheer wrath that, to Vandhiyathevan, resembled a\n",
      "ferocious cobra’ s forked tongue, slithering through its fangs. Despite\n",
      "himself, he shivered.\n",
      "“Ayya,” she turned to the young man, face and form suddenly full\n",
      "of maje sty. “You wish to escape this fort with your life intact, don’t\n",

      "“Deliver your olai to Kundhavai—but her reply , whatever that\n",
      "might be, must be delivered to me. Do you agree?”\n",
      "“A very dangerous stipulation, my lady .”\n",
      "“You prided yourself on never being afraid of peril just a while\n",

      "“Reward? So, you wish for an incentive, do you? You’ll certainly\n",
      "get one. The prize that you might never have conjured up, not in\n",
      "your wildest dreams. The reward that even PeriyaPazhu vettarayar ,\n",
      "the most powerful man in the Chozha empire, has awaited\n",
      "desperately for years—perfor med a veritable penance in fact, but to\n",
      "no avail. Should you choose to accept this commission, such a\n",
      "remuneration will be—yours.” And Nandhini fixed her exquisite eyes\n",
      "upon him again, her limpid gaze carrying every promise of\n",
      "breathless romance; employing the divine mohanastram , calculated\n",
      "to fell any man worth the title with devastating ef fect.\n",
      "Poor Vandhiyathevan stood rooted in front of her, dizzy beyond\n",
      "comprehension. Be still, my heart —be strong,  he mumbled to\n",
      "himself, disjointedly . Do not forget yourself —or take leave of your\n",
      "senses!\n",
      "And, as though to lend him assistance when he most needed it,\n",
      "an owl cried out just at that moment, in its most hideous voice.\n",
      "Once—twice—thrice—the hoots came, regularly .\n",
      "The hairs rose up on V andhiyathevan’ s body . His skin prickled.\n",
      "Nandhini gazed at the garden beyond, in the direction of the\n",

      "knows? He may aid you in your escape, somehow . Now, follow my\n",
      "instructions, and conceal yourself in the darkness.”\n",
      "And she pointed in the direction exactly opposite the one her\n",

      "“Do you remember?”\n",
      "Nandhini walked  to where the latha mandapam  opened out to the\n",

      "face—but was it stark, naked fear, or merely the gloom of trees that\n",
      "cast long shadows in the moonlight? It was impossible to tell.\n",
      "Ancient, colossal tree trunks, with vines winding around them\n",
      "could be seen for a little distance from the mandapam . Beyond, the\n",
      "garden was a large blob of deep darkness.\n",
      "The magician appeared from behind a tree, cleaving through the\n",
      "pitch blackness, pushing away masses of plants and creepers.\n",
      "Nandhini returned to her saprakooda  couch  and reclined\n",
      "gracefully , her beautiful face now clothed in tranquility .\n",
      "The mandhiravadhi  entered the mandapam; the lamp’ s golden\n",

      "Ah, familiar features, these—where have we seen him, before?\n",
      "Why, he appears to be one of the men who had gathered by the\n",
      "Thiruppurambiyam monument at midnight; who had shaken out a\n",
      "bagful of gold coins. The one who had growled out, “Kill\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan the instant you set eyes on him!” Indeed, this was\n",
      "Ravidasan.\n",
      "The man seemed to be simmering with wrath even as he walked\n",
      "in; the moment he set eyes on Nandhini, who lay on her couch,\n",
      "looking the very epitome of serenity , his cat-like eyes seemed to\n",
      "well-nigh explode with fury. He took his seat on a convenient\n",
      "manai opposite, and glared at her. “Hroom —hreem —hraam !” Hemuttered a few chants. “Bhagavathy—Sakti—Chandikeswari—!” he\n",
      "bellowed.\n",
      "“Enough! My stupid maid has fallen asleep at her post, I suppose.\n",
      "Say what you wish to at once!” snapped Nandhini. “He has entered\n",
      "the fort.”\n",
      "“Why , you wretch!” Ravidasan hissed, very like a ferocious\n",
      "snake.\n",
      "“Who?” asked Nandhini, calmly .\n",
      "“You, you ingra te! Devious, wretched Nandhini, who remembers\n",
      "nothing—the PazhuvoorIlaiya Rani, most ungrateful of women! You\n",
      "sly, scheming little witch!” And Ravidasan pointed an accusing finger\n",
      "at her .\n",
      "Nandhini stayed silent.\n",
      "“You appear to have forgotten quite a few things that ought to\n",
      "have been etched in your memory , woman,” continued Ravidasan. “I\n",
      "shall take it upon myself to recall them.”\n",
      "“What’ s the point of raking up those old stories, now?”\n",
      "“Why, you ask me? I shall tell you—once I have finished.”\n",
      "As though realizing the futility in stopping him, Nandhini heaved a\n",
      "much put-upon sigh and turned away .\n",
      "“Listen, Rani! Three years ago, in the cremation ground on the\n",
      "banks of the river Vaigai, burnt a funeral pyre. It was midnight, and\n",
      "none of the customary rituals and rites that usually accompany such\n",
      "a final act were performed for this one; nor were priests present.\n",
      "Twigs, sticks and dried leave s were scrounged from the forest floor\n",
      "and heaped; men brought out a corpse that had lain concealed\n",
      "behind a tree, and placed it on the pyre. They lit it and the fire burnt\n",
      "merrily , catchin g upon the logs. That was when a few men draggedyou from within the forest’ s gloom. Your hands and legs were bound;\n",
      "your mouth was gagged with an old cloth. Your lovely tresses which\n",
      "you now wear so elegantly , knotted and strung with fragrant flowers,\n",
      "were flowing down your back and all over the ground in a straggly\n",
      "mess. Those who brought you out were prepared to throw you onto\n",
      "the pyre as well, and burn you alive. “We shall wait until the fire\n",
      "grows!” swore a man. They left you on the ground for the time being,\n",
      "while each swore a terrible oath. You might have been  unable to\n",
      "speak, but your eyes and ears were open; you watched and listened\n",
      "for all you were worth. Once they had finished pledging themselves\n",
      "to their cause, they approach ed you—and you, silent and wide-eyed\n",
      "until that time, tried to use your hands desperately , to sign\n",
      "something. You rolled your eyes, wriggled your brows, and one of\n",
      "them saw it. “She seems to want to say something,” he pointed out.\n",
      "“Another of her old stories, I expect. Throw her into the fire!”\n",
      "snapped anoth er. “No, let’s listen to what she has to say, before we\n",
      "burn her. Remove her gag,” ordered a man. Since he happened to\n",
      "be their leader , his men obeyed.” Ravidasan paused. “Do you\n",
      "remember your words then, woman?”\n",
      "Nandhini answ ered him not; nether did she turn to acknowledge\n",
      "him. Disgust and sheer terror  painted her lovely face at that moment\n",
      "but also, along with them, shone a terrible, steely resolve. Two\n",
      "pearly tears trembled in her limpid eyes.\n",
      "“So, you do not wish to speak, do you? Fair enough, I shall recite\n",
      "the tale myself . You, my girl, swore that you would assume  the same\n",
      "cause as the men around you; that you would pledge yourself to\n",
      "exact the same revenge. This, you argued, was because you had\n",
      "more reason than any of them , to do so. You would use your beauty\n",
      "and brains, and assist the men however you could, and renounce\n",
      "your very life the instant your purpose was achieved—this was what\n",
      "you swore. The others did not believe a word, but I did—and I saved\n",
      "you from being burnt to a crisp.” Ravidasan stopped his narration.\n",
      "“Do you remember all this—any of it?”Nandhini turned a little, to glance at him. “Remember?\n",
      "Remember , you ask? Every word is etched in fire, in my very heart.”\n",
      "“Later , one day, we were walking in the dense jungle along the\n",
      "banks of the broad Kaveri, all of us. Suddenly , we heard the\n",
      "thundering hooves of cavalr y approaching. We decided to split up\n",
      "and hide in the forest—but you were the only one to deliberately\n",
      "disregard us. You stood where you were, and allowed yourself to be\n",
      "captured by those soldiers. Their leader Pazhuvettarayan caught\n",
      "sight of you and promptly fell head over heels for your charms. He\n",
      "wedded you, and I bore the brunt of my comrades’ anger—they\n",
      "believed that you had betra yed us. I resolved to get hold of you\n",
      "alone, somehow , and I did. I promised myself that I would plunge my\n",
      "trusty knife in your treachero us heart. But you begged for your life\n",
      "again. You swore that you were here to carry out your pledge, and\n",
      "that you would lend us every aid possible from within this very\n",
      "palace. Now—isn’t all this true?” barked Ravidasan. “ Isn’t it?”\n",
      "“Why wouldn’t it be? Why do you insist on repeating old history\n",
      "again and again? T ell me what you wish now , and be done with it.”\n",
      "“No, you do not remember any of those old times—you have\n",
      "forgotten your past, every single bit of it! You are lost in the luxuries\n",
      "of this Pazhuvoor palace—you dine upon lavish six-flavoured feasts;\n",
      "drape yoursel f in fine clothes and expensive jewelry ; laze on\n",
      "saprakooda  couches and silk mattresses and travel in ivory\n",
      "palanquins! You are a queen now, my lady—how could you ever\n",
      "remember where you came from?”\n",
      "“Chee ! Who cares about silks, mattresses, clothes and\n",
      "ornaments? Do you really think I live for such paltry objects? Not I!”\n",
      "“Or, perhaps you have fallen  for a beautiful face? The charms of\n",
      "some young idiot who passed you by in an alley? These little\n",
      "romances may have taken your mind from a revenge that is far more\n",
      "important, might they not?”Startled and a little self-conscious, Nandhini flushed crimson.\n",
      "“Such nonsense,” she spat, making a swift recovery . “Lies, all of it!”\n",
      "“Indeed? I intimated you of my arrival today , a good while  ago—\n",
      "and yet, you did not send your thaathippen , your handmaiden to\n",
      "receive me at the usual place. Why?”\n",
      "“I did— but someone else climbed up the ladder meant for you.\n",
      "That silly maid of mine mistoo k him for you and led him straight here.\n",
      "How is that my fault, pray?”\n",
      "“Who cares? Had I hesitated a moment more at that wall, I might\n",
      "have been mincemeat. The soldiers pursuing that young idiot of\n",
      "yours were almost upon me. It was all I could do to escape them—as\n",
      "it was, I had to scramble into the foliage adjoining this palace garden\n",
      "and plunge into a pond, holding my breath for God knew how long.\n",
      "And then I made my way here, dripping wet—”\n",
      "“Serves you right. You dared  suspect me of betrayal, did you?\n",
      "Consider your sins washed away by a dip in that smelly pond.”\n",
      "“Woman, answ er me this: did you really not lose your wits and\n",
      "heart to that handsome young man?”\n",
      "“Good heaven s, what a horrible idea! Who on earth would ever\n",
      "admire a man for being handsome? The shameless people of\n",
      "Chozha Nadu might praise their king for his good looks, but a man’ s\n",
      "true beauty lies in his battle scars, doesn’t it?”\n",
      "“Well said—bu t if this is what you truly believe, what was that\n",
      "young man doing here?”\n",
      "“I’ve told you; V asuki mistook him for you, and led him here.”\n",
      "“You even gave him your signet-ring—a favour you would not\n",
      "extend me. Why?”“To lure him here, of course. I wished to speak with him. Now that\n",
      "I have, I shall retrieve it—”\n",
      "“You did, did you? Why? What were you two lovebirds cooing\n",
      "about, all this time?”\n",
      "“I was cooing, as you put it, with a very important purpose in\n",
      "mind. He will prove useful to our cause, you’ll see.”\n",
      "“You little witch ! Proven yourself to be the stupid woman you are,\n",
      "have you? Betrayed us and our sacred cause to some silly boy we\n",
      "do not even know—”\n",
      "“Cease your foolish ravings. Why do you screech so? I betrayed\n",
      "nothing. If anything, I learnt a great deal from him.”\n",
      "“And what would that be?”\n",
      "“He carries an olai from Kanchi to Pazhaiyarai, to the tigress who\n",
      "resides there. He showed it to me, too. I was instructing him to bring\n",
      "her reply to me—which was when you barged in.”\n",
      "“Damn your palm-leaves and writing tools! What earthly use are\n",
      "such things to us?”\n",
      "“That’ s all you know . We’ve sworn an oath to destroy those tigers\n",
      "by their very roots, but all you think of are the males; you forget that\n",
      "a dynasty may continue through its women as well. And that’ s not all:\n",
      "who do you think holds the reins of Chozha Nadu, now? A pathetic\n",
      "Emperor who is paralyzed and stays in bed all day? Or the princes in\n",
      "Kanchi and Ilankai?”\n",
      "“That would be the man who has the honour to call you his wife;\n",
      "Dhanaadhikaari Pazhuvettarayar , of course. The whole world knows\n",
      "this!”\n",
      "“Wrong again. Certainly the world thinks so; why, even that batty\n",
      "old man entertains such foolish notions. I’m not surprised that you’vebeen fooled into believing it as well. In truth, it’s that little tigress at\n",
      "Pazhaiyarai who rules the land with an iron hand. She sits in her\n",
      "pretty little palace, pulling strings like a master puppeteer , and\n",
      "everyone danc es to her whim s and fancies. There seems to be no\n",
      "one who will take her down—but I will make sure she learns her\n",
      "lesson. And that’ s why I put that young man to good use.”\n",
      "Ravidasan considered her, a hint of surprise and grudging\n",
      "respect in his eyes. “Cunning, aren’t you? How do I trust you,\n",
      "though? Wher e is the proof that all this isn’t just a conv enient lie,\n",
      "made up for my benefit?”\n",
      "“I shall surrender that young man to you; lead him out of this fort\n",
      "through the secret passage. Make sure to blindfold him before you\n",
      "do. Wait in the vicinity of Pazhaiyarai, and make sure he brings\n",
      "Kundhavai’ s reply to me without fail. Should he try to deceive you or\n",
      "escape, you have my permission to kill him.”\n",
      "“Not on my life. You and he may go to hell for all I care!\n",
      "ChinnaPazhuvettarayar ’s men are seeking him within the city even\n",
      "as we speak; they will expand  their search outside the fort in a while.\n",
      "Team him with me and I shall be sure to be caught along with him.\n",
      "No—let us just discuss the purpose of my visit here.”\n",
      "“Which you haven’t revealed, yet, I might add.”\n",
      "“Arrangements are complete, regarding our men trave lling to\n",
      "Kanchi and Ilankai. Of course, things will be difficult for those\n",
      "journeying towards the island; they will have to exercise extreme\n",
      "caution and cunning—”\n",
      "“How am I a part of these problems? Don’t tell me you need more\n",
      "money? Good grief, is there no limit to your ceaseless greed for\n",
      "gold?”\n",
      "“We require it in such vast quantities for our cause and not for\n",
      "ourselves, as you well know . Why else do you think we have left you\n",
      "here, whole and well? The men we are sending to Ilanka i will needcoins of the island’ s currency; Chozha coins will not serve their\n",
      "purpose—”\n",
      "“All this prevarication for such an ordinary request! I have your\n",
      "precious gold coins ready , as you can see.” Nandhini bent down,\n",
      "pulled out a bag from underneath her couch, and handed it to\n",
      "Ravidasan. “This bag contain s all the Ilankai coins you need—now\n",
      "leave! He’ll be here soon.”\n",
      "She stopped him, as Ravidasan prepared to leave. “Wait a\n",
      "moment—at least escort that young man outside the fort. He may\n",
      "seek his path however he may. I have no great desire to show him\n",
      "the secret passage.” She rose on the words and glanced towards the\n",
      "darkened palace.\n",
      "It lay wreathed in inky blackness, and nothing was visible.\n",
      "Nandhini signed with her fingers and clapped her hands lightly, to no\n",
      "effect.\n",
      "She and Ravid asan walked along the latha mandapam , following\n",
      "the passage that connected the gallery to the gloomy mansion,\n",
      "towards its entrance. There was no one to be found, not in all the\n",
      "four directions.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan had, quite simply , vanished.\n",
      "•37\n",
      "The Clash of Lions\n",
      "The good people of Thanjaipuri cherished a wholesome,\n",
      "somewhat unique regard for the Pazhuvoor brothers. Hadn’t it been\n",
      "those great lords, after all, who had brought their old city new lustre\n",
      "and welcome pride?\n",
      "It is only natural that a procession of elephants, horses,\n",
      "palanquins and even the odd camel or two attracts a great deal of\n",
      "attention; people throng to see such events, gape at the opulence\n",
      "and drink in the festivities . Small matter , then, that Thanjai’ s\n",
      "residents accorded the same degree of importance every time\n",
      "PeriyaPazhuvettarayar entered or exited the fort; they ranged\n",
      "themselves on the sides of the roads, raising chants of victory ,\n",
      "shouting out blessings; showering the entourage with flowers and\n",
      "puffed rice.\n",
      "It was also the norm for ChinnaPazhuvettarayar to arrive  at the\n",

      "home after a visit.\n",
      "Their embrace , once they set eyes on each other , was a sight\n",
      "that inspired majesty and devotion, as though the very Nilagiri and\n",
      "Podhigai hills were clasping each other—such was their stature and\n",
      "splendour . As for the times both set off in procession through the\n",
      "wide avenues of the city, on their respective elephants or horses—\n",
      "ah, one needed ten thousand eyes to digest the magnificence of\n",
      "such a picture.\n",
      "Some considered them equa l to the asura  siblings, Hiranyan and\n",
      "Hiranyakshan; others were prone to call them SundhobhaSundhars.\n",
      "There were those who swore  that the affection that existe d between\n",
      "them was not unlike that between those epic heroes, Raman andBharathan, while still others considered them warrior brothers equal\n",
      "to Mahabharata’ s Bhima and Arjuna.\n",
      "Today however , matters were vastly different: neither\n",
      "PeriyaPazhuvettarayar ’s grand entrance, nor the suitably pompous\n",
      "performance delivered by his faithful entourage, served to stir up any\n",
      "excitement. The streets remained devoid of delighted welcome; not\n",
      "many people were present, for that matter . Even more important:\n",
      "ChinnaPazhuvettarayar was conspicuous by his absence.\n",
      "PeriyaPazhuvettarayar , howe ver, chose to disregard this flouting\n",
      "of convention, and proceeded straight to his younger brother ’s\n",
      "mansion. Thanjai’ s Commander must have been unavoidably\n",
      "detained by something important. Perhaps the Chakravart hy’s health\n",
      "had taken a turn for the worse—or perhaps—perhaps a certain\n",
      "significant event  had finally happened?\n",
      "Plagued by all these and more doubts, PeriyaPazhuvettarayar ’s\n",
      "impressive retinue reached the Commander ’s palace far sooner than\n",
      "usual.\n",
      "The younger arrived at the entrance to welcome the elder , his\n",
      "face plainly shrouded with worry and anxiety . He bowed respectfully;\n",
      "the brothers embraced. Then, they entered the palace—and made\n",
      "for the mandhiralosanai  chamb ers, meant for supremely confidential\n",
      "council.\n",
      "Once in private , the Periyavar came straight to the point. “You do\n",

      "—is it the Emperor? He is well, is he not, Kalanthaka?”\n",
      "ChinnaPazhuvettarayar , whose given name this was, nodded.\n",

      "“Why do you seem ill at ease, then? I did not receiv e your\n",

      "“A complete success, of course. Every single one of the invited\n",

      "very willing to raise swords and fight for our cause. Witness the\n",
      "sight: even KolliMazhavan and VanangamudiMunaiyaraiyar\n",
      "submitted completely to our decision—what more could we possibly\n",
      "need? As for Sambuvaraiyar , that man is eager to put his men,\n",
      "fortress, ramparts and wealth at our disposal, if it will aid our mission;\n",
      "his own son Kandamaaran is straining at the leash, frankly . Who\n",
      "cares about the mid-lands and Thirumunaippaadi, when we have all\n",

      "exquisitely delicate skin, my life, then my heart would splinter into\n",
      "pieces; it would have accomplished what a thousand battles and\n",

      "take you with me, into battle?  I cannot even bear to see you stand all\n",
      "this while, on these unforgiving stone floors! Come, my queen, pray,\n",
      "do recline upon your beautiful, flower-laden couch, that I may look\n",
      "upon your exquisite counten ance. Do not think, fair one, that these\n",
      "four days have wrought anguish upon your spirits alone—for I have\n",

      "gently to the saprakooda  couch.\n",
      "Nandhini brush ed away her tears and glanced up at him. The\n",
      "lamp’ s gentle light caught her lovely face, throwing her golden\n",
      "radiance into prominence— and the ravishing smile that bloomed\n",
      "upon it. The Chozha empire’ s Dhanaadhikaari  gazed at her, struck\n",
      "by the pearls that peeped amidst soft, coral lips. Ah, were they within\n",
      "my grasp, I would sacrifice all three worlds, just for a hint of this\n",
      "wondrous countenance —but as I lack these magnificent\n",
      "possessions, I shall have no compunction in placing my body , soul\n",

      "“You’ve been away from me for four long days—why didn’t you\n",
      "come home at once?  Your brother was far more important to you,wasn’t he?” retorted Nandhini, her face bright with mock anger; eyes\n",

      "“Not quite, my dear. I did want to come to you, straigh t as an\n",
      "arrow and true. I was detained, however , by that young idiot\n",

      "take care of themselves.\n",
      "With this very creditable intention, Vandhiyathevan retraced his\n",
      "steps—or tried to, at any rate. Was he truly on the right path? How\n",
      "could he ever know , in this inky blackness? Nothing barred his path\n",
      "this time; where had all those enormous pillars gone? Would he\n",
      "never be able to find the entrance? What if he had to spend thewhole night rambling all over this terrifying palace? Good God, what\n",
      "disaster had he let himself in for—?\n",
      "Wait—what was that sound? Sadasadasada —it sounded like\n",
      "fluttering wings . Where was it coming from? Bats, perhaps? Hardly\n",
      "surprising, if so; those creatu res were known to inhabit gloomy, dark\n",
      "places like these—no, no, these weren’t just bat-wings; there was\n",
      "the faint sound of footfalls as well. Someone was walking around\n",
      "here—but who? W ere these men? Or—or …\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan’ s thoughts froze; his tongue cleaved to the roof\n",
      "of his mouth, which went dry in an instant.\n",
      "Someone seemed to brush against his face. He gathered all his\n",
      "strength, swung his hand and sent his fist crashing into it.\n",
      "His valiant arm ached fit to break; cradling the abused digits,\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan felt for his presumed attacker—only to see that it\n",
      "was a formidable stone colum n. Not only had he almost walked into\n",
      "one of those huge pillars, but actually tried to engage in battle with it!\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan might have laughed out loud—had his hand not\n",
      "been almost exploding with pain, that is.\n",
      "His fears might have receded a little, but he was not free of them\n",
      "completely .\n",
      "For he could still hear those terrible footfalls—sometimes they\n",
      "sounded far off; at others, as though they were coming straight for\n",
      "him.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan stood rooted to the ground, listening for all he\n",
      "was worth; his eyes swung around to the direction of the footsteps,\n",
      "and stared hard.\n",
      "Ah—light! There was light, ahead—getting brighter by the\n",
      "moment—approaching him! Smoke accompanied the light as well;\n",
      "someone was arriving with an oil-torch. Was it Nandhini, perhaps, in\n",
      "search of him? That wouldn’t be a bad thing—but what if it wassomeone else? It would be wise to conceal himself; after all, there\n",
      "was no dearth of hiding-places here.\n",
      "The torch glided nearer; by its light, Vandhiyathevan saw that he\n",
      "was in a vast hall littered with massive stone columns; each had\n",
      "terrifying bhoodaganams , other-worldly genie-like creatures carved\n",
      "into them. A staircase seemed to climb towards the hall and curve\n",
      "upwards; the torch-light, he saw, appeared to move up from the base\n",
      "of said stairs— well, Nandhini  was certainly out of the question, then;\n",
      "it could not be her .\n",
      "Perhaps—was this, perhaps the way to the famed dunge ons of\n",
      "Thanjai that he had heard so much about? Did it exist under this very\n",
      "palace? W as one of its infamous residents coming up, now?\n",
      "Perspiration dotted every pore on Vandhiyathevan’ s skin; so\n",
      "many were the terrifying tales he had heard about the dungeons of\n",
      "this fort-city . He sought a particularly large column and slid behind it\n",
      "at once. As courageous as he was, even warrior Vallavarayan’ s\n",
      "limbs quaked at that moment.\n",
      "Three shadowy forms moved up the staircase—and all happened\n",
      "to be human. One carried a spear; another , a torch. The one in the\n",
      "middle howeve r, held nothing in his hands. Terror released its hold\n",
      "on Vandhiyathevan; intense amazement took its place when he\n",
      "caught sight of their faces in the steadily brightening torch-light. For\n",
      "the front-runner was none other than his dearest friend,\n",
      "Kandamaaran!\n",
      "As for the man in the middle … Vandhiyathevan felt a surreal\n",
      "feeling settle over him, as though he were watching the strangest\n",
      "illusion—for it looked startlin gly like Nandhini. The next instant, he\n",
      "saw that this was not true; this was a man; the beautiful prince\n",
      "Madhuranthakar in fact, whom he had barely peeked at, in\n",
      "KadamburSambuvaraiyar ’s palace. The third was unfami liar—some\n",
      "sort of a servant or soldier , no doubt.Vallavarayan’ s mind spun at an astonishing speed; within\n",
      "moments, he had unraveled the mystery of the trio slinkin g their way\n",
      "along this pitch-black staircase: Pazhuvoor ’s young queen had\n",
      "entered the fort a day ago; PeriyaPazhuvettarayar , the night before.\n",
      "Both had left and returned to the city in full view of the public—but\n",
      "Madhuranthakar was a different matter; his movements could not, of\n",
      "course, be known. Thus, the secret passage—and this was probably\n",
      "the real mystery behind the palace of shadows.\n",
      "As for Kandamaaran—once he saw Vandhiyathevan off on the\n",
      "banks of the Kollidam, the Kadambur scion had probably joined\n",
      "PeriyaPazhuvettarayar , who had promptly co-opted him into his own\n",
      "personal service. One of those duties had likely been escorting\n",
      "Madhuranthaka Thevar through this secret passage—a h! He did\n",
      "remember now that Kandamaaran had made obscure references to\n",
      "a task in Thanjai: “I may find myself there soon enough—I have a\n",
      "commission to execute …”—doubtless, this was it.\n",
      "What would his dear friend  think now if he, Vandhiya thevan,\n",
      "suddenly appeared in front of him?\n",
      "The next instant, he changed his mind. Presenting himself to\n",
      "Kandamaaran was the last thing he could do; the way situations\n",
      "were, and cons idering the oath he had sworn, one of two things was\n",
      "bound to happen: Kandama aran would be forced to kill him, or\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan would. Either , of course, was out of the question.\n",
      "Why on earth must he allow such complications to arise?\n",
      "By this time, the secret triad had climbed the stairs and vanished\n",
      "out of sight; the light dimmed steadily , as well. Vandhiyathevan\n",
      "considered following them for a brief moment, and swiftl y changed\n",
      "his mind. Doubtless, they were on their way to\n",
      "ChinnaPazhuvettarayar ’s palace and what was the use, pray, in\n",
      "Vallavarayan returning there ? He may as well place his head in a\n",
      "lion’s gaping jaw, having barely managed to escape it once, already .\n",
      "There was no point in returning to Nandhini’ s latha mandapam\n",
      "either; PeriyaPazhuvettaraya r might have arrived there, by now—and danger lurked in every corner . What else could do? As to that,\n",
      "why not climb down these very stairs himself?\n",
      "To think was to act. Our youn g warrior stepped gingerly onto the\n",
      "stairs, and began his wary descent.\n",
      "•41\n",
      "The Vault\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan descended into the gloomy secret passage,\n",
      "making sure every step was slow, but sure—and most important,\n",
      "that he did not fall headlong into the pitch-black void. The stairs went\n",
      "down for while—then leveled out—more descent—level again. He\n",
      "spread out his hands, hopin g to reach the walls, but found none.\n",
      "Suffice it to say that this was a vast passage, indeed. A while later,\n",
      "the steps ascended and then seemed to curve— appappa ! How\n",
      "much further was he suppo sed to go? How long was this path\n",
      "anyway , and how long must he stumble along this inky blackness?\n",
      "Ah—what was this now? The darkness seemed to be retreating a\n",
      "little! Very faint light appeared to meet his vision. Now, where could it\n",
      "possibly come from? Moonlight, perhaps, from somewhere in the\n",
      "roof? Chinks in the windows of this massive hall? Or was there a\n",
      "lamp stashed away in a hidden alcove, light escaping its prison?\n",
      "No, nothing of the sort! Why, what sort of sorcery was this that\n",
      "met his eyes— ? Was such a scene truly unfolding in front of him? Or\n",
      "had his brain finally scrambled itself for good?\n",
      "The mandapam  through which Vallavarayan was making his way\n",
      "happened to be built on a massive scale—carved from the very rock,\n",
      "and made into a fantastic underground chamber . This explained why\n",
      "the ceiling was so low that it often brushed his head. And as for the\n",
      "light—it certainly was not errant moon or lamp light, seeping through\n",
      "the roof or chinks in the walls. No, these strange rays came from\n",
      "something that lay in small heaps all along the walls, on the floor, or\n",
      "spread about in an untidy mess. Ah, and what a sight they did make,\n",
      "to be sure!Pearly beams danced off unearthly objects on the ground:\n",
      "beautifully finished crowns set with gorgeous rubies, emeralds and\n",
      "diamonds; there, on the other side, chains of gold, rich strands of\n",
      "pearls; necklaces gleaming with the fire of precious stones. And oh,\n",
      "that large vessel, now? Good God, it was filled to overflowing with\n",
      "white pearls glowing with understated sheen—like beautiful Punnai\n",
      "buds! Large, round, heavy pearls! Gold coins brimmed over that pot\n",
      "in the corner , glinting like the rays of the late evening sun. Here were\n",
      "gold bars—why , this seemed, in truth, to be the precious treasury of\n",
      "Thanjai! Hardly  surprising, in that case, that it lay concealed under a\n",
      "gloomy palace  right beside the Treasurer PeriyaPazhuv ettarayar ’s\n",
      "own mansion. Ah, and here Vandhiyathevan had been led, by God\n",
      "knew what good fortune—for hadn’t it been the combined grace of\n",
      "both Goddess  Bhagyalakshm i and AdhirshtaDevathai, Lady Luck,\n",
      "that had broug ht him in here? Hadn’t he learnt of one of Chozha\n",
      "Nadu’ s biggest secrets, through no great effort on his own? All that\n",
      "was necessary  now, was to divine how to make the best use of it.\n",
      "Forget that—h e didn’t even want to leave  this place. All his desires\n",
      "devolved to a pin-point: weaving through these treasures. Hunger\n",
      "and thirst would turn alien to him; he wouldn’t even feel the urge to\n",
      "sleep! What lay in front of his dazzled eyes were the fruits of over a\n",
      "hundred invasions by thousands of Chozhasoldiers; the result of\n",
      "their sweat and blood. He had heard monumental tales of those\n",
      "famed riches, the navanidhis  or the nine treasures—and all of them\n",
      "seemed to be here, at his very feet! Why, not even Kuberan, the lord\n",
      "of all worldly wealth could hope to beat a treasure trove such as this!\n",
      "Why on earth would anyone leave it all alone?\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan wandered among the treasures, powerless to\n",
      "tear himself away . He fingered the delicately fashioned  crowns in\n",
      "one corner; took up the necklaces that lay in another—the next\n",
      "instant he dropped them, strode over to the brass pot, plunged his\n",
      "arm into the pearls and watched as they dripped through his fingers,\n",
      "thunderstruck. He ploughed through another pot full of gold coins,\n",
      "gazing at them in wonder .Then—he caught sight of something else that seemed to glow\n",
      "dully, spread out in an expanse, in a corner , and went to investigate\n",
      "it. It defied explanation at first and Vandhiyathevan bent down,\n",
      "peering at the heap. The next instant, he jumped away , stunned.\n",
      "Ayyo—good God, it was a skele ton! A human being who had\n",
      "once possesse d skin, flesh, blood, nerves, hair, eyes, face and ears\n",
      "—and was now just a pile of bones. And—oh, it seemed to be\n",
      "moving—was it coming to life? Was it jingling and janglin g, very like\n",
      "the gold coins  he had touch ed a few scant instants ago? Was it—\n",
      "was it—trying to tell him something? Every hair on Vallavarayan’ s\n",
      "body prickled with terror . Had he finally , gone quite mad?\n",
      "Chee!—Of course not. The skeleton was as lifeless as ever; it\n",
      "was just a rat, trying to ease its way out from under it. Here it is,\n",
      "running over my foot. Ah, now that I see, the skeleton is quite still on\n",
      "the ground—but it is true, isn’t it, that it’s been trying to tell me\n",
      "something? Run away—do not tarry here. For I too, was a human\n",
      "being like you once, a living, breathing man—but I lingere d here too\n",
      "long and died, lost in this tomb! I am fated to crumble to dust. Do not\n",
      "repeat my mistake—run, run!\n",
      "This bag of bones is perfectly right to warn me—should I stay, I\n",
      "shall share its fate. I must leave at once, at once for if I don’t, I’m\n",
      "done for!\n",
      "In vain did Vandhiyathevan try to find a way out—to no purpose. \n",
      "There seemed to be no path of escape; neither could he find the way\n",
      "he had come. No matter  where he went in this wretched\n",
      "underground vault, the demon of darkness welcomed him with its\n",
      "gaping maw; the corners were especially terrible. As for peering\n",
      "down—he felt as though he were slipping into hell itself; it seemed to\n",
      "descend forever , into unfathomable darkness. The stairs he had\n",
      "taken must be around here somewhere; all he had to do was run into\n",
      "them.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan wandered endlessly through the hall, hoping to\n",
      "stumble agains t them. On one of his endless circuits, he almost raninto a heap of gold coins. He stared hard at what seem ed to be a\n",
      "web of some sort—ah, a spider ’s web, shiny and delicate, spreading\n",
      "its tendrils over the coins. Almost in spite of himself, it set off a train\n",
      "of thoughts within him.\n",
      "He had heard elders speak often of the perils of land, women,\n",
      "and gold; of the way they spun complicated webs of allure, waiting\n",
      "for men to commit the gravest sins—much like a spider that awaits\n",
      "its prey. And a fly arrives from nowhere, fascinated by the trap and\n",
      "alights on it—whereat the spider draws in its hapless prey, and\n",
      "swallows it whole. Such were the three great temptations of\n",
      "mankind: they lay in wait so man would get caught in their toils, and\n",
      "once he did, there was no escape whatsoever .\n",
      "As for Vandhiyathevan—strange indeed, that he had managed to\n",
      "encounter all three the very same day! There had been the young\n",
      "queen of Pazhuvoor , Nandhini, at first, who had tried to ensnare him\n",
      "with her considerable beauty ; not satisfied with that, she had tried to\n",
      "overpower him with wily words about the Vaanar dynasty’ s ancient\n",
      "lands, and held aloft the vain hope that she might procur e them for\n",
      "him. And now, here was the vast treasure of Thanjai, enticing him\n",
      "with its gleaming, glittering attractions in a bid to swallow him whole!\n",
      "He had manag ed to escape with his wits intact from the first two—\n",
      "now he would have to walk away from the third as well.\n",
      "After all—why must  he concern himself with vast kingdoms,\n",
      "wealth and the lures of willful women? This great land, with the sky\n",
      "as its marvelous roof was his palace in every way; and wasn’t there\n",
      "a famou s verse, a unique, fulfilling philosophy that he’d heard from\n",
      "his Thamizh ancestors often: “YaadhumOore; YaavarumKelir ”— All\n",
      "the countries on earth are my home; everyone here is my family ?\n",
      "And in truth, the earth was his and its residents, his friends. What\n",
      "could be bette r than to visit them all, hopping from one kingdom to\n",
      "another of his own sweet will? He would spend his life traveling by\n",
      "rivers that overwhelmed their banks with fresh floods; glory in\n",
      "luxurious forests where trees  sprouted new leaves in the spring, and\n",
      "birds of every feather and colour flitted across the heavens; gazewith delight at deer, peacocks, hills with summits that touched the\n",
      "very skies; stand in awe by vast oceans as their waves crashed onto\n",
      "the shores—thus would he live, eating what he could, wherever he\n",
      "found food; sleep where the urge overtook him. Ah, this, indeed, was\n",
      "the sort of life worth living! And a wonderfully satisfying one it would\n",
      "be too. Why on earth would anyone want to give up something like\n",
      "this, so easily within his grasp, and choose a life fraught with\n",
      "conspiracies, perils and desires that were more dangerous than\n",
      "death itself? Somehow , he would have to escape this wretched\n",
      "chamber; then the palace of gloom and Thanjavur itself. Never would\n",
      "he allow himself to be caught in their toils again—\n",
      "—but wait. Was that the sound of a door opening? Were those\n",
      "footsteps again? Ah, would there never be an end to the night’ s\n",
      "mysterious happenings? Nor the terrors, apparently .\n",
      "It seem ed to Vandhiyathevan that the footfalls, this time, seemed\n",
      "to come from very far away —and from two different directions to\n",
      "boot. He sharp ened his ears and listened as keenly as he could; his\n",
      "eyes cleaved through the inky blackness in all four directions,\n",
      "straining to see something, anything. And in a while, he had his\n",
      "reward.\n",
      "It was as though a koothu  was playing itself out on a stage set\n",
      "very far away , and those acting their roles were minute figures upon\n",
      "it— from where  he stood, Vandhiyathevan watched events unfold at\n",
      "a considerable distance, on what seemed a slightly elevated plane.\n",
      "A torch appeared from one side of the koothu  stage; another\n",
      "shifted aside the screen, and appeared from the opposite. The two\n",
      "drew closer and closer to each other . Two dark, hefty figures came to\n",
      "light in one; two more, in the other . One of the latter was tall and\n",
      "majestic while the other , petite and slender . The two parties\n",
      "approached each other evermore, and Vandhiyathevan’ s eyes\n",
      "almost bulged with the strain of identifying them. By dint of great\n",
      "effort, he was successful: the figures on the left were Kandamaaran\n",
      "and his escort; the ones to the right were PeriyaPazhuvett arayar and\n",
      "his young queen, Nandhini Devi.What would happen, Vandhiyathevan wondered, when these two\n",
      "parties ran into one another ? Some sort of catastrophe? Or would\n",
      "they meet in a convivial fashion and leave way for the other? He\n",
      "almost forgot to breathe as suspense gripped him, watchi ng the two\n",
      "groups converge.\n",
      "Considering the way they stumbled about with some confusion,\n",
      "an unexpected meeting appeared to have been the last thing on their\n",
      "minds; both parties seemed amazed and perplexed at running\n",
      "across each other in the dark—but contrary to Vandhiyathevan’ s\n",
      "fears, nothing  disastrous occurred. PeriyaPazhuvettarayar asked\n",
      "something of Kandamaaran , to which that young man gave an\n",
      "answer . Vallavarayan could hear none of their exchange, however .\n",
      "The Pazhuvoo r lord made some sort of sign and pointed towards the\n",
      "secret staircase, to which Kandamaaran reciprocated by bowing low\n",
      "with deep reverence, and proceeding towards said stairs.\n",
      "PeriyaPazhuvettarayar watched him walk way, and then made a\n",
      "gesture to Kandamaaran’ s menial, who still held aloft the burning\n",
      "torch. That worthy bowed in turn, accepting the command with his\n",
      "palm over his mouth. He followed Kandamaaran almos t at once,\n",
      "while the Pazh uvoor lord and his consort went on their way, to the\n",
      "left.\n",
      "All these events, almost like something out of a mysterious\n",
      "shadow-tale or a fascinating street-play had happened within the\n",
      "space of a few moments and, Vandhiyathevan guessed, by the steps\n",
      "that led down to the underg round chamber . Ah, what a fortuitous\n",
      "coincidence, then, that he hadn’t dawdled about by the staircase and\n",
      "had wandered instead, into the chamber itself! What a terrible state\n",
      "of affairs would it have been if he had ended up between  these two\n",
      "parties? Thank fully, that possibility had not come to pass and he was\n",
      "safe.\n",
      "Now what, though? He would still have to find a means of\n",
      "escape. There  was no doubt that Kandamaaran was making his way\n",
      "back, having escorted Madhuranthaka Thevar to his residence; he,\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan, had probably veered off his own course and endedup in the treasu ry. Following his friend now would doubtles s lead him\n",
      "to the door that led outside the fort—and once there, he would come\n",
      "up with a ruse to bluster his way out. Why, he could  even ask\n",
      "Kandamaaran for assistance or, if the worse came to worst, take him\n",
      "on and his servant in a bout. Either way, following the Kadambur\n",
      "prince was the best option, now .\n",
      "The torch seemed to approach the chamber at first.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan sucked in his breath and stood stock-st ill. Then, it\n",
      "seemed to move away and by its light, he saw the steps by which he\n",
      "must have descended into the vault. He went down them once\n",
      "again, and climbed up with noiseless feet, making sure he kept the\n",
      "light in his range of vision, taking the greatest care never to alert his\n",
      "friend of his presence. Up and down he went, marve ling at the\n",
      "curves and twists in the path, the dead-ends and endless loops that\n",
      "seemed designed to confound anyone—good heavens, no one could\n",
      "hope to follow it in the dark and make it outside, safe and sound!\n",
      "Long live Kandamaaran—bu t how and where could Vallavarayan\n",
      "ever repay this aid, rendered unbeknownst?\n",
      "There was no way he could have guessed that an opportunity\n",
      "was about to present itself, in a matter of moments.\n",
      "The end of the secret passag e was in sight, at last; a vast stone\n",
      "wall rose in front of them, at an impressive height. It was almost\n",
      "impossible to suppose that it concealed some sort of entrance and\n",
      "yet—there must  be one, mustn’t there?\n",
      "Kandamaaran’ s guide shifts his torch from his right hand to the\n",
      "left, places his free hand on the wall and does something—he seems\n",

      "smashing onto the wall of the secret passage.\n",
      "He lay as though dead but Vallavarayan, once he had\n",
      "approached the man cautiously and ascertained that he was indeed\n",

      "the dagger stuck in his back; his spear lay beside  as well.\n",
      "Vallavarayan stepped out and dragged clear Kandamaaran’ s body ,\n",
      "picking up the spear; the passage closed at once. The massive walls\n",
      "stood silent, clothed in shadows, guarding their eternal secret from\n",
      "prying eyes.\n",
      "Judging by the stiff winds that almost blew him away ,\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan guessed that he was finally outside the fort. Trees\n",
      "loomed upon the horizon, not to mention the enormous battlements\n",
      "and fort ramparts, which meant that moonlight was meager indeed.He hoisted Kandamaaran onto his shoulder , scooped up his\n",
      "spear and took a step forward—only to feel the earth slipping away\n",
      "under him, almost carrying him away in a landslide. He stuck the\n",
      "spear in the ground and with considerable effort, halted his\n",
      "downward progress. Then, he craned his neck and peered down.\n",
      "Amidst the thick shadows thrown by ramparts and trees on the\n",
      "ground could be seen flowing water—and, Vandhiyathevan spied, in\n",
      "the dim light, that it whirled and tumbled forward at great speed.\n",
      "Thank heavens, then, that he hadn’t put his foot right into it—or he\n",
      "would have somersaulted straight into disaster! God had, indeed,\n",
      "saved him, but that treacherous guard—ah, what was the point in\n",
      "thinking of him now? Doubtless, he had only carried out his master ’s\n",
      "instruction: to stab the Kadam bur prince in the back and dispose of\n",
      "the body by throwing it into these floods. Had Vandhiyathevan not\n",
      "been inordinately surefooted, both would be tumbling into the water ’s\n",
      "depths, by now. And even had Vallavarayan managed to regain his\n",
      "footing, Kandamaaran was sure to have gone to a watery grave.\n",
      "The Vaanar scion had learnt, before this, of the RiverV adavaaru\n",
      "that almost hugged the Than javur fort walls at one point— well, this\n",
      "must be it, then. And though the river was not supposed to be\n",
      "swollen with floods, it might well have been considerably deep at this\n",
      "point by the fort; who knew? Vandhiyathevan dipped his spear into\n",
      "the waters, testing the depths—and found, to his horror , that even\n",
      "fully submerged, it did not strike the bed. Ah, those wretched, bloody\n",
      "rogues—!\n",
      "But there was no more time to be lost in reflecting upon these\n",
      "betraying idiots; he and Kandamaaran had to make their escape\n",
      "right away .\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan stepped forward, taking the greatest care that he\n",

      "shoulder and his spear gripp ed tight in his hands. His injured friend\n",
      "groaned and moaned twice  or thrice which was, frankly , rather\n",
      "encouraging.He trudged on for a while, gritting his teeth, until the fort-walls\n",
      "seemed to move away; the forest began to creep in along the banks.\n",
      "Thorns lay aplenty underfoot , which made the going difficult but oh,\n",
      "what was this—a large tree, right in the river! Of great height as well;\n",
      "the river must have scoured its roots and weakened them; it lay\n",
      "almost to half the river ’s breadth.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan climbed onto it and staggered along its length,\n",
      "trying to keep his balance on a trunk that wove a little from one side\n",
      "to another , in the waters;  its branches and leaves thrashed\n",
      "helplessly amidst the swirling currents. The wind howled around him\n",
      "as well. He made his way to the end of the tree and stuck  his spear\n",
      "into the waters again—thank s be to Lord Murugan! For the waters\n",
      "were not quite so deep here. He stepped off the tree and into the\n",
      "river, treading gingerly , feelin g his way across troughs and crests in\n",
      "the bed, making sure he withstood the winds and raging floodwaters\n",
      "through the sheer force of his mind, and perseverance.\n",
      "His body shuddered helpless ly sometimes, with the strain of it; at\n",
      "others, it seemed as though his friend might slip and fall into the\n",
      "river. And yet, Vandhiyathevan braved all ills and finally scrambled\n",
      "onto the shore. He staggered  for a while along the banks, trembling\n",
      "in clothes that were drenched to the waist, still hefting a\n",
      "Kandamaaran who was of not inconsiderable height and weight. A\n",
      "little later, the densely clustered trees gave way into a small clearing\n",
      "and he stopped, lowering his precious burden slowly to the ground.\n",
      "First in the order of things was to take a respite, for the moment\n",
      "—but he wished to know if there was still life in his friend’ s body . For,\n",
      "what was the purpose in lugging along a corpse? Far better to take\n",
      "that wretched guard’ s cours e and throw it into the river—no, no,\n",
      "Kandamaaran was still alive; his chest rose and fell with heaving\n",
      "breaths; a tumultuous pulse thudded in his wrist.\n",
      "So far, so good —but now what? Removing the dagger was out of\n",
      "the question; blood would gush out and kill him. No, what\n",
      "Kandamaaran needed at once was medicine; his wounds  had to be\n",
      "dressed with skill—but these were hardly tasks that could beaccomplished by him alone, were they? No, Vandhiyathevan needed\n",
      "assistance, but who else would—\n",
      "Wait, what about SendhanAmudhan? His home and garden were\n",
      "on the banks of the RiverV adavaaru, weren’t they? Bound to be\n",
      "somewhere nearby , surely? Kandamaaran might have a chance of\n",
      "survival if Vandhiyathevan managed to drag them both to Amudhan’ s\n",
      "home. What did he stand to lose, anyway?\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan bent towards his friend, prepared to heft him\n",
      "onto his shoulders again and stopped—for Kandamaaran’ s eyes\n",
      "were open. “Why , Kandamaaraa—you’re awake! Do you recognize\n",
      "me?” Delight and amazement suf fused his countenance.\n",
      "“Very well indeed. You’re Vallavarayan, of course; how could I\n",
      "forget such an excellent friend? You’re the kind that stabs a man in\n",
      "the back, aren’t you?”\n",
      "“Ayyo!” The last word s lashed at Vallavarayan like a vicious whip.\n",
      "“But I wasn’t the one who—” he stopped abruptly , as though\n",
      "remembering something.\n",
      "“Of course not; all your knife  did was caress me like a feather—\n",
      "you bastard! You were the reason I hurried down the secret passage\n",
      "at all—I wanted to get hold of you before Pazhuvettarayar ’s men did\n",
      "—to prevent anyone else capturing and torturing you. I swore that I\n",
      "would find you somehow , and enlist you in ChinnaPazhuvettarayar ’s\n",
      "Fort Guards Regiment—and here you are, betraying the friend who\n",
      "wished to help you! Is this the mark of true friendship? Have you\n",
      "forgotten all the times we clasped hands, swearing to protect each\n",
      "other? Now you—you’ve destroyed everything! Ah, how eager I was\n",
      "to tell you of—of the stunning changes that were about  to sweep\n",
      "through this Chozha Empire— how I wished to warn you about—but\n",
      "how am I ever to trust anyone again?” Kandamaaran closed his\n",
      "eyes, slipping into oblivion. The effort of such hurried and furious\n",
      "speech had doubtless drained his strength.“Surely there’ s no lack of people to trust?” Vandhiyathevan\n",
      "mumbled. “Who on earth would rely on the Pazhuvettarayars,\n",
      "anyway?” For all that, however , tears started in his eyes. He blinked\n",
      "hard and conc luded that he had been wise to stay silent, after all.\n",
      "Then, he heav ed Kandamaa ran upon his shoulder and resumed his\n",
      "journey .\n",
      "The scent of blooms engulfed him thickly , in the stillness  of the\n",
      "night; he had been right to assume that SendhanAmudh an’s home\n",
      "must be nearabouts. And within moments, he did reach the\n",
      "nandhavanam — but oh, what a difference between his first visit and\n",
      "this one! Now, that beautifully kept garden looked like the ancient\n",
      "Ashokavanam destroyed by Lord Hanuman in a fury; like the\n",
      "exquisite madhuvanam  wrecked by the vaanarams , the monkey-kind\n",
      "of Ramayana. Ah, it did seem like PeriyaPazhuvettarayar ’s dutiful\n",
      "men had descended here as well, in search of him—and  paid their\n",
      "respects in due fashion, heaping destruction. To think of all the\n",
      "trouble to which SendhanAmudhan and his dear mother had gone,\n",
      "maintaining this wonderful, rich little garden! And now—everything\n",
      "was in rack and ruins.\n",
      "Abruptly , Vandhiyathevan remembered his own precarious state\n",
      "—and all thoughts of sympathy for the flower garden vanished. What\n",
      "if those wretched spies and security guards lurked about, still? Well,\n",
      "he had no choice but take them on. Thank heavens at least for his\n",
      "horse, though, which stood tied to the tree … wait, what if this was a\n",
      "trap as well? No matter; there was nothing he could do but relinquish\n",
      "Kandamaaran into the care of these excellent people and fly upon\n",
      "his steed—which would, God willing, halt only in Pazhaiyarai.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan tiptoed across the garden, towards the hut. At\n",
      "the entrance, he bent forward and tapped SendhanAmudhan, who\n",
      "lay fast asleep on the thinnai . The boy jerked awake, startled—upon\n",
      "which the warrior laid a swift hand over his mouth. “You’re the only\n",
      "one who can help me, Thambi ,” he spoke, in a low voice. “I find\n",
      "myself in terrible difficulties. This is my dear friend,KadamburSambuvaraiyar ’s son Kandamaaran. Someone stabbed\n",
      "him, you see. I saw him on my way out and brought him with me.”\n",
      "“Why , those rogues!” exclaimed Amudhan. “They’ve stabbed him\n",
      "in the back too, brave warriors!” He paused for a moment. “I shall\n",
      "care for him as much as I can. Several groups of soldiers barged\n",
      "here in search of you and wreaked havoc on our beautiful garden—\n",
      "see, there’s almost nothing left of it. Never mind, though ; it matters\n",
      "nothing if you manage to escape. Thankfully , they’ve left your horse\n",
      "alone—now get on it and leave!”\n",
      "“That, Thambi , is my intention as well—b ut oughtn’t we to do\n",
      "something about saving my friend’ s life?”\n",
      "“Don’t you worry about that; my mother knows her way around\n",
      "medicines. She’s well-versed in handling wounds such as these.”\n",
      "And SendhanAmudhan tapped gently on the door, twice. It opened\n",
      "at once, and his mother stood in the entrance.\n",
      "They carried Kandamaaran into the house slowly and laid him in\n",
      "the koodam , the hall. Send hanAmudhan signed to his mother in the\n",
      "gentle light of a hand-held lamp; it seemed that she understood him.\n",
      "She gazed keenly at Kanda maaran; glanced at the dagger in his\n",
      "back and left swiftly , returnin g with rags and a few medicinal herbs.\n",
      "Then, she looked meaningfully at the two of them.\n",
      "SendhanAmudhan gripped the Kadambur prince tight.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan gathered himself, placed a hand on the dagger\n",
      "sticking out of his friend’ s back, and pulled it out.\n",
      "Blood gushed  out of the wound. “Oh!” Even unconscious,\n",
      "Kandamaaran screamed in agony .\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan covered his mouth swiftly .\n",
      "SendhanAmudhan pressed down on the bleeding wound as hard\n",
      "as he could.His mother dressed the injury efficiently , with fresh herbs.\n",
      "Kandamaaran groaned pitifully , again.\n",
      "Footsteps thudded in the distance—men running towards the hut.\n",
      "“Go—now!” Amudhan admonished. “Quickly!”\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan picked up the blood-stained dagger and spear ,\n",
      "and then hesitated. “ Thambi —you do believe in me, don’t you?”\n",
      "“I believe in God. And I do like you. But—why do you ask?”\n",
      "“I require your assistance again. You see, I’m new to these parts,\n",
      "and don’t quite  know my way around. I wish to reach Pazhaiyarai at\n",
      "once and deliver a message to Kundhavai Devi. Would you be able\n",
      "to guide my way a little?”\n",
      "At once, SendhanAmudhan turned to his mother and signed\n",
      "something, to which she signified assent. The lady, it seemed, was\n",
      "not unduly perturbed by the night’ s happenings. She signed to him,\n",
      "in addition, that she would take care of the injured man as well.\n",
      "They left toget her; Thevan on his horse while Sendhan climbed\n",
      "on behind him. Vandhiyathev an set his steed to a quiet trot, careful\n",
      "not attract the slightest attention. A little distance, and he set the\n",
      "horse gallopin g. The animal tore through the night, carrying its\n",
      "burden.\n",
      "Five or six soldiers descended upon the hut the instant the steed\n",
      "set off; they banged on the door furiously . Amudhan’ s mother\n",
      "opened the door , and stood framed by the entrance.\n",
      "“What was the noise we heard just now?” yelled a soldier .\n",
      "Amudhan’ s mother quavere d some sort of vague, blubbering\n",
      "response.\n",
      "“What’ s the point of asking this deaf mute?” snapped another .\n",
      "“We’d better go in and see for ourselves.”“She’ s barring our path, isn’t she?”\n",
      "“Where on earth is that flower-boy?”\n",
      "“Swat away that mute and get into that cottage!”\n",
      "Amudhan’ s mother howled something more in her own, unique\n",
      "tongue, and tried to shut the door in the man’ s face. Four or five of\n",
      "the brawny soldiers push ed themselves through, making it\n",
      "impossible for her to do so. She shrieked something and abruptly , let\n",
      "the door go—upon which two or three lost their balance and\n",
      "practically rolled in through the entrance, falling at her feet. The\n",
      "others trampled over them, in their haste to enter the hut.\n",
      "“Here he is!” yelled one.\n",
      "“Finally!” crowed another . “Got himself into our clutches, did he?”\n",
      "“Grab him before he runs,” instructed another . “Tie him up!”\n",
      "The mute woman blubbered wildly .\n",
      "“Good God—what’ s with all the blood?” echoed a soldier .\n",
      "Amudhan’ s mother held aloft the lamp and pointed to the injured\n",

      "Four of the brawny men hefted up Kandamaaran. “Beh—Beh—\n",

      "radiant counte nance, and an undeniable majesty annou nced: here\n",
      "was a queen among queens, a woman born to rule, who had married\n",

      "her every wish, held her in such great esteem, and neve r gainsaid\n",

      "Religion, in those days was a vastly different affair from what it is\n",
      "in the present: Saivism and Vaishnavism were yet to undergo\n",
      "segregation. Devout followers of Vishnu co-existed with fierce\n",
      "Saivites, often in the same family . One priest was quite likely to\n",
      "perform worsh ip and rituals at both a Siva Temple and Thirumaal’ s\n",
      "holy abode; Eesana Siva Battar was one such enlightened, broad-\n",
      "minded soul. Thirumalaiyappan happened to be his brother onceremoved; both cherished deep affection for each other , despite their\n",
      "differences—which explained why Battar craved pardo n for his\n",
      "brother ’s transgression.\n",
      "“Peace, Thirumalai, and speak calmly ,” smiled the Queen. “What\n",
      "is all this talk of injustice now?”\n",

      "excellent repair and held the river in check for years. Then, for a\n",
      "period, the Chozha reign’ s brilliance dimmed; their power\n",
      "diminished; others who had lain in wait for just such a circumstance\n",
      "such as the Pandiyas, the Pallavas, Kalappalasand Vaanars rose to\n",
      "prominence. The Kaveri, stumbling without her kaavalan , her king,\n",
      "began to break her banks, shifting without direction and\n",
      "overwhelming the lands.\n",
      "There were, of course, occasions when she did more than just\n",
      "wash over fields; sometimes, Ponni changed path altogether . And\n",
      "then, the river’s course often shifted drastically: Old Kaveri became\n",
      "the New Kaveri, and the reverse was true as well. So radically did\n",
      "her route change that dry beds often transformed into nansei  or rich,\n",

      "Chozha kings had deepened the natural depression, widening its\n",

      "upon the many royal residences along its banks, particularly\n",
      "anthappurams . No one could cross unless by ferry, and even this\n",

      "forget royal protocol and dance like peacocks, or lift their voices in\n",

      "beautiful. Luxu rious banyan trees grew along the many paths, their\n",
      "numerous vines anchored to the ground; tiny bushes found a place,\n",
      "as well. Flowering creepers wound fragrant tendrils around sturdy\n",

      "The two princesses, however , saw no reason to laugh; neither did\n",
      "they seem to relish the mirth of others in the vicinity . As to the\n",

      "blue-tinged God.\n",
      "The moon showers its gentle  rays upon the earth, one night. The\n",
      "melodious notes of Kannan’ s flute waft through the air, falling upon\n",
      "the ears of a young woman. Her heart is lost to Him, and His musical\n",

      "one boasted of only one, underneath its gopuram .\n",
      "The easiest route to Eesana Siva Battar ’s home was through the\n",

      "a circuitous one that consumed a good deal of time.\n",

      "almost dragged him outside.\n",
      "“Why , Anna , what’ s this?”\n",
      "“You wish to know , do you? I shall tell you, Thirumalai, and in\n",

      "seemingly in a towering rage. None of Thirumalai’ s pleas moved\n",
      "him, and before his distraught younger brother could go further , he\n",
      "had stalked back in and banged the huge doors shut, drawing the\n",
      "bolt securely .\n",
      "“So that’s how it is, is it?” Azhwarkkadiyaan loitered in front of the\n",
      "temple for a while, mumbling to himself. Then, he circled  the whole\n",
      "precinct, Jain caves and all, two or three times, taking care to go left\n",
      "instead of right—to do so the other way around might end in a proper\n",

      "every one of the manmade caves was closed. Later , he made his\n",
      "way to his brother ’s home, where he was made heartily welcome by\n",
      "the good Battar ’s wife, who relished Thirumalai’ s witticisms a great\n",

      "sarcastic best, regaling her with thrilling accounts and jokes and took\n",

      "with prasadham  from the Sivan Temple, Thirumalai belched,\n",
      "waddled to the thinnai  and sprawled upon it.\n",
      "Somewhere between sleep and wakefulness, his mind wandered\n",
      "over the happenings of the previous day—and lit upon one particular\n",
      "event.Thirumalai was ambling along the banks of River Kudamurutti,\n",
      "when his ears were assaulted  by the thundering of horse-h ooves, on\n",
      "the opposite side. Quick to think on his feet, he slunk behind a\n",
      "thicket of luxurious bamboo trees.\n",
      "A horse careened on the shore, first, seemingly without direction;\n",
      "it seem ed drenched—from sweat or having swum across the river,\n",
      "Thirumalai could not guess. A young man, almost a boy, was bound\n",
      "to it. He looked frankly terrified—but underneath was a streak of\n",
      "determination, as well. Four or five horses galloped up behind him,\n",
      "all bearing soldiers armed with spears; they were nearing the\n",
      "runaway steed with every moment. One of the men rose from his\n",
      "perch, his spea r held aloft as if to throw it, but his cohort leaned over\n",
      "and stopped him.\n",
      "The boy’s steed passed under a thick cluster of bamboo trees at\n",
      "that moment; one of the slend er branches, already dropping towards\n",
      "the ground, tangled in the youngster ’s tresses. The horse strained to\n",
      "move forward; the branch yanked at the rider’s hair. Just as\n",
      "Thirumalai shuddered at the latter ’s fate, his pursuers galloped up\n",
      "and surrounde d him. They took one look at his youthful, pale\n",
      "features, and appeared overcome by surprise and dismay .\n",
      "Pelted with their sharp questions, their quarry stammered and\n",
      "stuttered his replies, none of which were very audible to\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan. “Where’ s he? Where? ” was a question repeated\n",
      "often, to which the boy sobbe d and heaved pitifully . “He’s gone—the\n",
      "waters took him—the floods swept him away!”\n",
      "The men soon trussed him up, secured his horse and marched\n",
      "both long the banks.\n",
      "None of this had made much sense to Azhwarkkadiyaan at that\n",
      "time —but now they seemed, finally , to reveal some of their\n",
      "significance.\n",
      "In the midst of all this intruded the memory of the Balaram an and\n",
      "Krishna theatre troupe he had stumbled upon that day; in particular ,the man donning the costu me of Kamsan, his face veiled by a\n",
      "wooden mask. Something about his body language and speech had\n",
      "seemed vaguely familiar . Now—now , he could see glimmerings of\n",
      "light, about the true identity of the so-called actor .\n",
      "The first thing Eesana Siva Battar saw when he returned home\n",
      "late that night, upon the completion of the ardhajaamampoojai  at the\n",
      "Sivan temple, was his erstwhile beloved younger brother sprawled\n",
      "upon the thinnai . “Thiru malai!” he called out. “Thirumalai !”—voice\n",
      "practically ringing with fury .\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan moved not a muscle, feigning deep sleep. The\n",
      "Battar gave him up as a lost cause, stalked into his home and\n",
      "banged the door shut in a way calculated to rouse the street:\n",
      "Padaar ! His raised voice within reached even Thirumalai, sunk as\n",
      "the Battar was in some sort of discussion. It seemed to have\n",
      "developed into a verbal altercation—the subject of which, Thirumalai\n",
      "guessed, was himself.\n",
      "The next morning found Eesana Siva Battar accosting his errant\n",
      "brother once more. “When will you begin gallivanting about the\n",
      "country , again?”\n",
      "“Once your anger has died down, Anna .”\n",
      "“Do not call me that. You—I am no longer your elder brother and\n",
      "you, certainly , have no claim upon me as my thambi —you\n",
      "blaspheming scoundrel! Neechan —sandaalan —”\n",
      "“Pray , why do you curse him so?” Battar ’s wife hurried up, quick\n",
      "to speak up for her brother-in-law . “What has he done now, that he\n",
      "has not done before? It is you who have turned into a Siva fanatic!”\n",
      "“Quiet! If you knew what he spoke in the great Queen’ s presence\n",
      "yesterday— Why does this Paramasiva n, a mad ascetic dancing\n",
      "among skulls and ash in a cemetery need temples , he asks! It was\n",
      "as though someone had poured boiling hot lead into my ears—and I\n",
      "hear that Her Majesty did not sleep a wink last night, the poor lady!”“Thirumalai will repeat no such thing, in the future. Indeed , I shall\n",
      "make sure he learns from his mistakes. And why would he not, as\n",
      "long as we instruct him the right way?”\n",
      "“Right and wrong ways, my foot! What he must  do right away is\n",

      "and only that will be the means of his redemption. And until he does,\n",
      "I shall certainly never set eyes on this heinous creature’ s face!”\n",
      "finished Eesana Siva Battar , in a magnificent display of temper .\n",
      "Thirumalai’ s lips twitched— with the overwhelming impulse to\n",
      "return every one of his broth er’s taunts with interest, of course—but\n",
      "now was not the time. Should he speak a word out of turn, all his\n",
      "painstaking ef forts would have gone to waste.\n",
      "“Of course—why would he not?” butted in the Battar ’s wife, once\n",
      "again. “He will be certain to obey any command of yours . Come to\n",
      "think of it, would it not be an excellent plan to accompany him? So\n",
      "many years and not a child of our own—doubtless,  we have\n",
      "committed a grave sin that must be remedied with worship.\n",
      "Thirumalai,” she turned to her brother-in-law . “Why do we not all\n",
      "journey to Rameswaram?”\n",
      "Eesana Siva Battar glared at them both, and stalked away . Some\n",
      "time later, he confronted Thirumalai again—but this time, in a\n",
      "somewhat tranquil frame of mind. “Our elders do say Kobam,\n",
      "Paapam, Sandaalam —anger leads to nothing but destruction. And I\n",
      "am afraid I have given way to wrath,” he admitted. “You have not\n",
      "taken my hasty words to heart, I hope?”\n",
      "“Not at all.”\n",
      "“In that case, stay here. I shall return once I have completed\n",
      "midday worshi p; there are a few important matters I wish to discuss\n",
      "with you, and upon which I require your opinion. You will stay here,\n",
      "won’t you?”“I’ve no intention of leaving you—now , or ever , Anna .”\n",
      "The Battar departed, satisfied.\n",
      "“So that’s how it is to be, is it?” Azhwarkkadiyaan mumbled to\n",
      "himself a few times—and then left, abruptly . He made his way\n",
      "around the Vada Metrali Temple and its caves twice or thrice, making\n",
      "sure to conceal himself at the slightest hint of sound.\n",
      "His wait was not in vain. Within a few moments, one of the gates\n",
      "to the Jain caves creaked open—and Eesana Siva Battar peered\n",
      "out. He stared keenly in all three directions, before stepping out\n",
      "gingerly . Someone else followed him outside—ah, now who might\n",
      "this be? By the look of him, it certainly seemed to be the one who\n",
      "had earlier donned Kamsan’ s costume. But who was he? Ha, so this\n",
      "was the reason for the Batta r’s elaborate deception—his taunts and\n",
      "convoluted temper tantrums. W ell, well, well!\n",
      "The men from the muzhai  began to walk swiftly;\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan was careful to keep his distance, out of their\n",
      "eyesight, as he dogged their steps. They walked for a while before\n",
      "reaching a quay—the one upon the artificial lake that edged the royal\n",
      "residences, choppy with waves almost like an ocean. But this one\n",
      "happened to be situated in the west, at a great distance from the\n",
      "palaces.\n",
      "The banks boasted a luxurious growth of thick trees;\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan slunk behind one, and peered out from between\n",
      "two branches.\n",
      "A boat bobbe d upon the choppy surface; it looked, upon\n",
      "inspection, like a royal craft. A boatman waited upon the shore. The\n",
      "moment he spied the Battar and his companion, he dragge d the boat\n",
      "closer , in readiness for them, apparently . The men promptly climbed\n",
      "in.\n",
      "Once the little craft began to float away , the Battar ’s companion\n",
      "turned towards the shore. For an instant, his face was clearly visible—and Azhwarkkadiyaan recognized him at once.\n",
      "Not that the revelation came as a surprise; he had arrived at an\n",
      "accurate conclusion as to the man’ s identity , by now. It was, in fact,\n",
      "none other than the valiant young man he had met in Veera\n",
      "Narayanapuram, and on the banks of the river Kollidam!\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan had no doubt, moreover , that “Kamsan” had been\n",
      "the very same warrior , as well.\n",
      "All that remain ed, now, was to discern the secret assignation of\n",
      "these two men—or , as Azhwarkkadiyaan swiftly amended himself, to\n",
      "confirm that his suppositions regarding their destination was correct,\n",
      "of course.\n",
      "Among the many palatial residences that lined the royal avenue,\n",
      "nearly piercing the skies, one in particular , at the very end, lay silent\n",
      "and empty . Once the honourable seat of SundaraChozhar ’s Chief\n",
      "Minister , Aniruddha Brahmaraayar , the palace was now under lock\n",
      "and key: the venerable minister was on one of his many state visits\n",
      "to Madurai, the Pandiya capital, providing much needed restoration\n",
      "to ruine d royal administration; his family currently resided in Thanjai,\n",
      "which meant that none remained in Pazhaiyarai.\n",
      "It was here that Azhwarkka diyaan finally made his way. The\n",
      "palace guards at the entranc e bowed in deference at his arrival, and\n",
      "opened the doors wide at his command. Once within, they closed\n",
      "and locked the doors from the outside as per his instructions.\n",
      "Azhwarkkadiyaan crossed all three kattus  or sections of the\n",
      "rambling residence and reached the gardens, where he swiftly\n",
      "routed out a slender track cutting across the luxurious bushes and\n",
      "many creepers that twined round each other , glorying in the lack of a\n",
      "gardener . He walked steadily  along the narrow path until he reached\n",
      "Kundhavai’ s royal gardens, where he located a cunningly placed\n",
      "alcove and hid himself, swiftly .\n",
      "Judging by what followed, not a single one of his painstaking\n",
      "efforts were in vain.For something did happen—a dramatic event worthy of the poetic\n",
      "skills and elegant verses of masterful bards such as\n",
      "MahakaviKalidasa himself, and many such others.\n",
      "The boat crept along the wate rs, edging towards the shore; when\n",
      "it stopped, Eesana Siva Batta r and Vandhiyathevan climbed out, and\n",
      "began up the steps leading to the gardens.\n",
      "At a little distance from the stairs waited IlaiyaPirattiKundhavai\n",
      "Devi, majestic upon a marble seat placed most artistically , in her\n",
      "garden.\n",
      "The travelers ascended steadily from the shores; Princess\n",
      "Kundhavai rose, the moment they reached the last stair. It was then\n",
      "that Vandhiyathevan raised his head and caught a glimpse of the\n",
      "gracious young lady .\n",
      "He stopped short and stood still, transfixed at the vision in front of\n",
      "him.\n",
      "A slend er vine crept up just then, its delicate tendrils reaching\n",
      "between the young man and Kundhavai, as though seeking to\n",
      "obstruct their view. A beautiful butterfly , its dazzling, fragile wings\n",
      "fluttering in the sunlight, alighted gently upon it.\n",
      "Kundhavai bent her radiant, golden countenance a little, gazing\n",
      "at the butterfly , entranced.\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan, on the other hand, drank in her delicate,\n",
      "blooming beauty , unable to even blink.\n",
      "The lake churned with restless, foaming waves.\n",
      "Birds in the heavens ceased their restless twitters. Time and\n",
      "space, it seemed, stood still.\n",
      "And aeons passed.\n",
      "•48\n",
      "Whirling Pools and Swirling Eyes\n",
      "Aeons ago, God created the first man, the AadhiManidhan , who\n",
      "made his home upon a mountain slope. Sturdy rock caves guarded\n",
      "him from wind and gales; luxurious trees and foliage growing thick\n",
      "upon the mountain provided him with fruits that satisfied every one of\n",
      "his heart’ s cravings. Beasts of the jungle lived in perenn ial fear of\n",
      "him; he himself, led a life free of worry or fear, free as the birds that\n",
      "wheeled in the sky. And yet—yet, there seemed to be something\n",
      "sorely lacking. A yawning pit opened up somewhere in the region of\n",
      "his heart—a deep yearning, a lack haunted him every passing\n",
      "moment. He could not quite define it, but some sort of mysterious\n",
      "force seemed to drag him in directions unseen. He seemed to be\n",
      "seeking, at all moments, something he had neither seen nor\n",
      "experienced, thus far. By day, he allowed his imagination full rein\n",
      "over this object; by night, his subconscious took over in the form of\n",
      "dreams. This marvelous treasure that I seek —this luscious\n",
      "karpagakkani —this strange force that tugs at me—how do I find it?\n",
      "When?  The question s haunted him day and night, and his heart\n",
      "fluttered, aching for some sort of reprieve.\n",
      "Meanwhile, God had given form to the AadhiSthree , the first\n",
      "woman, the same instant he created her male counterpart . She lived\n",
      "on the other side of the mountain. Fruits from trees quenched her\n",
      "hunger; fresh water from the mountain’ s sources slaked her thirst,\n",
      "and she lived in a cave that afforded excellent shelter . In other\n",
      "words, she suffered no want —for all intents and purposes. And yet,\n",
      "a fire burned deep within, tormenting her every moment; a\n",
      "mysterious force seemed to bind and tug her somewhere. But where\n",
      "did it wish her to go? And why did it possess her spirit so? These\n",
      "were questions for which she knew not the answers.A towering mountain thus separated the world’ s first man and\n",
      "woman—preventing them from setting eyes on each other .\n",
      "One day, the weather followed the vagaries of a scorching\n",
      "summer; a forest fire began  to rage through the mountain in all\n",
      "directions. So swiftly did it cut across the vast swathes of vegetation,\n",
      "its tongue licking the plants and trees, that the man and woman\n",
      "knew there was no hope of escape. None, at least, through the\n",
      "jungle; the only way was to climb up to the summit. That was where\n",
      "they caught their first sight of each other .\n",
      "And stood completely still, hardly daring to blink.\n",
      "Forgotten was the forest fire, and even the reason for their\n",
      "sojourn to the summit. Gone was every instinct of hunger and thirst.\n",
      "This. This was, they realized, the reason for their existence—to\n",
      "meet each other , at this very instant. This, then, was the mysterious\n",
      "force that had pulled and tugged at them. Within each other , they\n",
      "realized, lay the key to their hearts; within themselves resided the\n",
      "only means to fill the gaping  emptiness that had made their lives\n",
      "miserable. And having found each other—there was no force on\n",
      "earth, they realized, that had the power to separate them.\n",
      "High above in his celestial abode, Brahmmadevan, who had\n",
      "observed this magical meeting with some trepidation, realized that\n",
      "the good work had begun—and returned to his divine duties, duly\n",
      "satisfied.\n",
      "It would be safe to say that our Vallavarayan and Princess\n",
      "Kundhavai resembled the first man and woman, at this very moment.\n",
      "This was what they had sought, all their lives, whispered a voice,\n",
      "deep within their hearts. This was indeed, what they had waited for;\n",
      "the meeting that defined their very existence.\n",
      "Unlike the AadhiManidhan  and Sthree , however , princess and\n",
      "warrior were bound by the dictates of their society and culture;neither could ignore the difference in their respective statuses, which\n",
      "meant that they could not give in to their newfound, rapturous\n",
      "feelings. Their eyes, however , played an elaborate dance, sinking\n",
      "into each other one moment; shifting to flowers, trees, butterflies and\n",
      "the lake nearby , the next.\n",
      "Eesana Siva Battar , having decided that enough time had passed\n",
      "in silent conversation, cleared his throat—which was when both\n",

      "important purpose.\n",
      "“I believe you petitioned Eesana Siva Battar to seek a private\n",
      "audience with me?” IlaiyaPiratti’ s voice held a good deal of severity .\n",
      "Her authoritative tone, calculated to snub pretension, touched\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan to the quick . He straightened to his full height in\n",
      "spite of himself. “I am not sure I may volunteer an answer without\n",
      "knowing your identity ,” he returned, very much on his mettle. “I\n",
      "wonder ,” he murmured. “Has Eesana Siva Battar led me here\n",
      "erroneously?”\n",
      "“Indeed, I am plagued by such doubts as well. Who was it that\n",

      "“In that case—surely you aren’t the young lady I met in the\n",

      "Arisilaaru?”\n",
      "“Yes, yes, guilty as charged, on both occasions, especially when\n",
      "it came to my mannerless conduct. You didn’t expect to meet such asocially inept woman again, did you?”\n",

      "decided, and had spent the hours skulking in bamboo forests and\n",
      "plantain groves, choosing to walk steadily along the river banks once\n",
      "darkness fell. Weariness overtook him sometime around the third\n",
      "jaamam  that night, and he decided to take his ease in a ruined\n",
      "mandapam .\n",
      "The moon shone its pearly rays upon the earth, turning night into\n",
      "day; some of its radiance reached even a little inside the crumbling\n",
      "edifice. Vandhiyathevan moved beyond the light, and lay down in the\n",
      "shadows. Sleep beckoned him. Even as he felt his eyes close all by\n",
      "themselves, he was shaken  awake, rudely , by a horrible screech\n",
      "very near him. An owl.\n",
      "Hadn’t he heard the same screech during his conversation with\n",
      "the PazhuvoorIlaiya Rani, in her latha mandapam ? Vandhiyathevan\n",
      "rose hastily . Deep in the darkness, two tiny spots of light seemed totrain themselve s on him. He took two paces towards the entrance—\n",
      "when the sound of footsteps stopped him.\n",
      "Someone had just entered the mandapam .\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan sidled behind a broken, ruined pillar and peered\n",
      "out. The moonlight fell on the newcomer ’s face—and the Vaanar\n",
      "warrior realized that he was none other than the mandhiravadhi ;\n",
      "Nandhini’ s erstwhile visitor .\n",
      "Much to his surprise, the magician seemed to make the pillar his\n",
      "target; Vandhi yathevan hope d that the man was unaw are of his\n",
      "concealment, and would walk away .\n",
      "His hopes were ruined. The mandhiravadhi , tiptoeing like a\n",
      "stealthy cat until he reached the pillar, suddenly fell on\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan and clutched his neck with a loud, inhuman shriek.\n",
      "“The signet ring!” he howled. “Give me the palm-tree signet ring now\n",
      "—or I will strangle you this instant!”\n",
      "Vandhiyathevan could barely breathe—his throat felt like being\n",
      "crushed in a vice; his eyes startled out of his head as though they\n",
      "would pop out; he heaved and panted.\n",
      "And yet, somehow , he reined in his panic. He caught hold of the\n",
      "old pillar, gathered his strength, and threw out his leg in a mighty\n",
      "kick. The mandhiravadi  crumpled to the ground with a scream. The\n",
      "pillar chose to crash that moment; stones and rubble began to rain\n",
      "down from the roof. A terrified bat flapped its way out of the\n",
      "mandapam ; so did Vandh iyathevan, as fast as his legs could take\n",
      "him. Only when he was sure of no pursuit did he stop, finally ,\n",
      "catching his breath.\n",
      "His legs shook and body trembled even now, when he recalled\n",
      "that night.\n",
      "“Ayya?” Kundhavai’ s melodious voice shook him out of his\n",
      "reverie, somew hat, and restored equilibrium. “How long has it been,since you left Kanchi?”\n",
      "“A week and a day , Devi.”\n",
      "“Wonder of wonders, then, that you’ve managed to earn quite so\n",
      "many enemies within such a short space of time. Pray, how did you\n",
      "accomplish such a feat?”\n",
      "“That would prove to be a very long story indeed, Y our Highness.”\n",
      "“You may recount it to me, nevertheless. My decision to entrust\n",
      "you with another mission depends, you see, upon knowing every\n",
      "detail of your journey , so far.” She turned to Eesana Siva Battar at\n",
      "this moment, and called him aside. “The boatman—what sort of a\n",
      "person is he?”\n",
      "“Deaf as a post in both ears. He wouldn’t notice thunder if it tore\n",

      "“Excellent. Shall we embark on a boat ride, then? We would do\n",
      "well to row across the lake for a while; I wish to listen to his account\n",
      "in its entirety ,” remarked the princess, walking swiftly towards the\n",
      "shore.\n",
      "A thrill of exhilaration coursed through Vandhiyathevan. On a\n",
      "boat—in comp any of the illustrious Chozha dynasty’ s exalted\n",

      "have earned a great deal of virtue in at least seven past lives, to be\n",
      "the recipient of such excellen t fortune! Now that the Gods  had seen\n",
      "fit to bestow such largesse upon him, he would ensur e that the\n",
      "unlooked-for expedition lasted a very long time\n",
      "indeed;V andhiyathevan would describe his adventures  in such\n",
      "terms, and with so many endless paragraphs that it neve r came to\n",
      "an end. Never let it be said that he ended a story far too quickly .\n",
      "Such strokes of luck did not always find their way to peop le—where\n",
      "was the need for any hurry?Vandhiyathevan’ s instincts may have been creditable indeed—\n",
      "but he had reckoned without Kundhavai’ s own. The mome nt the boat\n",

      "that a few fell from the moun tain and onto the forests of Kodikkarai\n",
      "during his flight, which is why we still harvest such wonderful\n",

      "Vandhiyathevan who, Kundhavai noted, amused, had dressed\n",
      "himself in the latest of fashio ns with the utmost care. Even Vanathi\n",
      "seemed to recognize him. “Why , Akka ,” she whispered into her\n",
      "companion’ s ears. “It does seem to be that young man from the\n",
      "Kudandhai Astrologer ’s home, doesn’t it?”\n",
      "“So it would seem,” Kundhav ai’s tone was bland in the extreme.\n",
      "“What’ s more, he’s visiting the Vaidhyar after barging into the home\n",
      "of an astrologe r. Perhaps the poor man suffers from some hideous\n",
      "mental affliction, like you?” She turned to Vandhiyathevan. “You,\n",
      "Ayya, are the warrio r who is willin g to undertake a journey to Ilankai\n",

      "herbs for the wellbeing of the Emperor; government officials on their\n",
      "path are to render whatever assistance necessary , in accomplishingtheir task. The other was addressed specifically to the guardian of\n",

      "“Excellent. I see no reaso n for them to tarry, then,” said\n",
      "Kundhavai. “Surely they may leave at once?”\n",
      "“Why , certainly ,” assented V andhiyathevan.\n",
      "Easier said than done, however .\n",
      "The whole cavalcade exited the infirmary . The royal elephant,\n",
      "ambaari  at the ready , stood prepared to allow the princesses to\n",
      "mount. Two stallions, fleet-fo oted as the wind and fairly twitching for\n",
      "a gallop had been brought over from the palace as well, for the\n",
      "messengers.\n",
      "And yet—it did not seem as though everyone concerned could\n",
      "begin their journey at once. Vandhiyathevan, for instance, seemed to\n",
      "be beset with a veritable plethora of doubts that had to be assuaged\n",
      "that very instan t; Kundhavai, for her part, seemed to be plagued by a\n",
      "thousand perils that might endanger her messenger , and of which\n",
      "she thought it best to warn him. In particular did she instruct him\n",
      "about the dangers he might be expected to encounter , upon his\n",
      "journey .\n",

      "Left with no further pretext to dawdle, Vandhiyathevan wheeled\n",
      "his horse—with  a great deal of reluctance, it must be admitted. Hecraned his neck and gazed at Kundhavai one last time, eyes fairly\n",
      "brimming with eagerness and yearning.\n",
      "Then, abruptly , he delivered a slap to his stallion, as though\n",
      "furious with it; that well-bred animal sprang forward, quite  unused to\n",
      "such cavalier treatment. It sped away , kicking up a cloud of dust; the\n",
      "Vaidhyar ’s son had to gather all his considerable inexperience just to\n",
      "follow him.\n",
      "Kundhavai fell into a reverie as the elephant made its ponderous\n",

      "“Well, theives make away with such useless things as silver and\n",
      "gold in the ordinary way, but this one seems a vast sight more\n",
      "dangerous—I fear, very much, that he wishes to steal Chozha’ s\n",

      "Lacking a throne, his only ambition was to distinguish himself in the\n",

      "Rattling along the streets in state, their conversation, such as it\n",

      "“Why not?” queried Miladudaiyar . “Have you forgotten who ruled\n",

      "grievous error on nature’ s part— that one? Or a warrior among\n",

      "such realms. Pray, tell me, though, how law and justice stand upon\n",
      "this matter. Had it been resolved right at the beginning that\n",

      "“I would not; not now, not ever. Should you ever decide to bestow\n",
      "this empire on Madhuranthakan yourself, in a fit of benevolence, my\n",
      "first instinct would be to cut you into a hundred pieces with this\n",

      "then I, I who brought your mother into this world—I shall kill myself\n",
      "with my own bare hands! Never—not until my body releases its last\n",

      "Somewhere along the way, the voice of our\n",

      "our elder grand mother , all of us; we’d grown up in her fond embrace,\n",
      "after all. We ran up to the little arbour where she sat, to tell her about\n",
      "our play. There  were three other people in there, aside from her. One\n",
      "was a young girl around our own age. The other two were  obviously\n",
      "her parents. They were speaking to Maadevadigal about their\n",
      "daughter . They  stopped, and everyone stared at us, as we erupted\n",
      "into the little space. But I—th e only thing I saw was the girl’s large\n",

      "AdithaKarikalan returned to earth, and continued his tale. “It was\n",
      "my sister Kundhavai who tumbled out the whole story about our\n",

      "heavens, how can I even look at her without laughing? What do I\n",

      "“I understood something very important, in that instant: women\n",

      "she can’t stand to see another as pretty . My sister ’s beauty was\n",
      "famed amongst all our clan—but not even she could bear another\n",
      "girl’s loveliness. What else could be the reason behind all her catty\n",
      "remarks? But then, I wouldn’ t let her alone either; I exaggerated the\n",

      "quarreled about her, often; our young brother Arulmozhi would stare\n",

      "pursued them right up to Sethukkarai. Those who had managed to\n",
      "escape death at our hands hastened into ships, and left our shores\n",
      "hotfoot. My father wished to teach a lesson to the Ilankai king, who\n",
      "kept sending troops to assist the Pandiyas and caused us endless\n",
      "trouble; he decided to send a large force there, under\n",
      "KodumbalurSiriyaV elaar . It took some time to gather the ships, men\n",
      "and material required for such a large undertaking—but still, we\n",
      "stayed there for awhile until the vessels were loaded and sent on\n",
      "their way. We returned to Chozha Nadu only after having  learnt that\n",
      "our men had disembarked in Maathottam, safe and sound.”“Two years had passed, by the time I returned to Pazhaiyarai. I’d\n",
      "forgotten the poor little priest’s daughter who’d come to us from\n",
      "Madurai or thereabouts. But when I entered the palace and saw her\n",
      "and my sister—they’d changed beyond all recognition. They were\n",
      "very friendly , these days, I noticed. Not only had Nandhini grown—\n",
      "she fairly dazzled, dressed in silks and ornaments. This, I learnt, had\n",
      "been my sister ’s doing. Nandhini, however , refused to meet my eyes\n",
      "or speak to me, as in the old days. I tried very hard, I admit, to\n",
      "remove these hindrances; my greatest delight lay in her company ,\n",
      "when I could bring her to overcome her bashfulness. I can’t really\n",
      "explain why I felt this way—I certainly couldn’t understand my\n",
      "exhilaration when I was young. During those days, my heart was\n",
      "overflowing with a sort of ecstasy , like the new floods that break the\n",
      "banks of Kaveri. I realized something else too: those around me\n",
      "didn’t quite like any of this. Kundhavai began to detest  Nandhini,\n",
      "ever since my return; my grandmother , Maadevadigal called me\n",
      "aside as well, one day: “She’ s a priest’ s daughter; you, however , are\n",

      "advisable for you to be friends.” I, who had revered her as a deity\n",
      "until then, and placed great faith in her judgment, now grew quite\n",
      "angry; I refused to heed her words. I went against her express\n",

      "her friendship. Not that any of this lasted for long. I learn t, one day,\n",
      "that she and her parents had suddenly left for their village in Pandiya\n",
      "Nadu. Sorrow crushed me—and fury, as well. I locked away my\n",

      "Manyaketa (roughly present day Maharashtra) and invade \n",

      "Prince Raja-aditya had a brilliant idea while his large \n",

      "benefit of the population. Enormous quantities of flood \n",
      "waters flowing in the Kollidam river were going \n",
      "wastefully into the sea. Wishing to make use of these \n",
      "waters, he made his soldiers build a huge, spreading \n",
      "reservoir. In honor of his distinguished father he named it \n",
      "the Veera Narayana Lake. He then established the town of \n",

      "It was to this temple that Vandiya Devan went in Azlvar -\n",
      "adiyan's company. At the sanctum sanctorium Azlvar -\n",
      "adiyan began singing. He sang a few devotional poems by \n",
      "Andal. He then sang a few verses of Nammazlvar:\n",
      "Praise, praise,praise the Lord,Gone is the curse of this wretched life;\n",
      "There is nothing left here for Lord Yama,Who created the hells of despair and death;\n",

      "from his eyes and streamed down his cheeks. Vandiya \n",
      "Devan listened attentively. Though tears did not stream \n",
      "from his eyes, he was very moved. His biased opinions \n",
      "about Azlvar-adiyan were somewhat tr ansformed. This \n",
      "fellow is very devout, he thought.\n",
      "Several others listened to the songs with interest. The \n",

      "\"I entreat you to teach this child all the songs you know,\" \n",
      "requested the priest.\n",
      "In later years this town was to attain several honors. The \n",
      "boy with the childish face shining with  devotion would \n",
      "grow up to be known as Nadamuni Adigal the foremost of \n",

      "all thousand poems; set them to music; sing them and \n",
      "along with his disciples popularize those songs all over the \n",

      "important Chozla nobleman in those days. His castle gates \n",
      "resembled the entrance of a large city -stronghold. The \n",

      "A number of elephants, horses, large bullocks as well as \n",

      "Something special seems to be taking place here; why have \n",
      "I come here now ... At the same time he felt an \n",
      "overpowering urge to find out what the special occasion \n",
      "was. The fortress gates were wid e open although men \n",
      "holding long lances stood near the gates. They looked like \n",
      "the messengers of Yama, the Lord of Death.\n",
      "The dauntless youth decided that the best thing to do \n",
      "would be to ride boldly and go in; any hesitation on his \n",

      "thoughts into action. But what a disappointment?! As soon \n",
      "as the horse neared the gates, lances crossed in front to \n",
      "obstruct the way and stop him. Four men came forward \n",

      "action, he said \"Let go of my horse. I am going back.\"\n",
      "The gate-keepers let go of the reins. Vandiya Devan \n",
      "employed both his legs to apply a sudden pressure to the \n",

      "flashing like swift lightning in his hand appeared like God \n",
      "Vishnu's spinning Chakra (discus). The horse galloped \n",
      "forward into the fortress. The men in the way seemed to \n",
      "suddenly fall down. Lances and spears wer e thrown apart, \n",
      "clanging noisily. The horse flew amidst the gossiping men \n",
      "of Pazluvoor. The totally unexpected, lightning attack \n",
      "scattered the men in all four directions.\n",
      "Several other actions took place immediately: The fortress \n",

      "boomed \"dadam, dadadam\". Several men -- maybe twenty, \n",
      "thirty, fifty or even more -- surrounded Vandiya Devan \n",
      "and his horse. He jumped down to the ground; swirling his \n",

      "parted to make way for a youth coming hurriedly.  He \n",
      "noticed Vandiya Devan who stood there twirling his \n",
      "sword, like God Muruga after killing the Demon Soora.\n",
      "\"Vallava! Is it truly you?\" he said in an emoti onal voice \n",
      "and ran forward to heartily embrace his friend. \n",
      "\"Kandamara because you repeatedly insisted, I came to \n",
      "your house. I received this warlike welcome here,\" \n",
      "Vallavarayan pointed to the men around him.\n",
      "Kandamaran said to his men, \"You idiots! Move a side. \n",
      "Your brains are like budding shoots on a pounding block.\" 2Kandamaran took hold of his friend's hand and led him \n",
      "hastily into the castle. His feet did not stay put on earth; \n",
      "and his heart danced with joy. What can captivate the heart \n",
      "of a youth more than a true friendship from his youthful \n",
      "days? Yes, of course there is a thing called kaadal (love). \n",
      "But being in love has as much sadness and pain as joy and \n",
      "pleasure. In the cheerful friendship of youth there is not \n",
      "even a shadow of sadness. All is hear t pleasing happiness.\n",
      "\"Kandamara, what is all this hustle and bustle about? What \n",
      "is happening here today?\" asked Vandiya Devan.\n",
      "\"Oh! I'll explain what's happening here afterwards. \n",
      "Remember the days when you and I were at the army \n",

      "you can meet them all here tonight,\" said Kandamaran.\n",
      "He then took his friend up to the upper chambers where the \n",

      "Sambuvaraya and said \"Father! I have mentioned several \n",
      "times about my friend Vandiya Devan of the Vaanar Clan. \n",
      "This is he.\"  Vandiya Devan bowed and g reeted him with \n",
      "reverence. However, Lord Sambuvaraya did not seem too \n",
      "happy about it.\n",
      "\"Is that so? Is he the fellow who created all that \n",
      "disturbance at the palace gates below?\" asked the father.\n",
      "\"He was not the cause for the disturbance. It's those idiot s \n",
      "we have for gate-keepers\" said the son.\n",
      "\"Still, he need not have arrived in this sensational manner; \n",

      "lord Sambuvaraya.\n",
      "Kandamaran frowned. He did not wish to continue the \n",
      "debate with his father. He led Vandiya Devan aside. He \n",
      "presented his friend to Lord Pazluvoor, seated on a lofty \n",
      "throne amidst the other guests, and said \"Uncle! This is my \n",
      "dear friend Vandiya Devan. He is from the noble Vaanar \n",
      "clan.  He and I were on guard duty at the army bas e north \n",
      "of the Pennar river. In those days he would often express a \n",
      "wish to `See and meet the bravest among warriors, the \n",
      "great Lord of Pazluvoor' and would often ask `Is it really \n",
      "true that he has sixty-four war-wounds on his body?' I \n",
      "would tell him `One day you can meet him and count \n",
      "them'.\"\n",
      "\"Is that so Thambi? Will you not believe it unless you \n",
      "personally count  them? Such distrust?  You suspect that \n",
      "none but one of the Vaanar clan can be brave?\" said Lord \n",
      "Pazluvoor.\n",
      "Both friends were startled. They ha d not expected the \n",
      "nobleman to thus misconstrue their words of praise. \n",
      "Vandiya Devan felt irritated. Without showing his feelings he said \"Sir! The fame of the brave Pazluvoor clan has \n",
      "spread from  Cape Comorin to the Himalayas. Who am I to \n",
      "doubt it?\" \n",
      "\"Good reply. Intelligent fellow\" muttered Lord Pazluvoor.\n",
      "With a feeling of having escaped with that, the friends \n",
      "went out. Lord Sambuvaraya called out to his son and \n",
      "whispered, \"Serve your friend some food as early as \n",
      "possible and tell him to go and sleep in some secluded \n",
      "spot. He seems tired after a long journey!\" Kandamaran \n",

      "Kandamaran's sister. He had imagined all sorts of things \n",
      "based upon Kandamaran's descriptions of his younger \n",
      "sister. In a way, he was now disappointed. His eyes \n",

      "\"My mother is calling me. Wait right here. I'll be back \n",

      "The voices of several women talking all at once, the sound \n",

      "Kandamaran answering them with some  confusion could \n",
      "be heard. He also heard the women inside laughing gaily. \n",
      "The thought that they were perhaps laughing at him caused \n",
      "some shame and anger in Vandiya Devan. When \n",
      "Kandamaran came out, he took hold of his friend's hand \n",

      "Were the women so happy to see me, your friend?\"\n",
      "\"They were all very happy to meet yo u. In fact my mother \n",
      "and others liked you a lot. But they were not laughing \n",
      "about you ...\"\n",

      "these years he has recently married a very young girl. He \n",
      "has brought her here in a covered palanquin. Apparently he \n",
      "has kept her locked up in his own chambers without \n",
      "sending her to the inner apartments in the palace. One of \n",
      "the maids who saw the girl by peeping in through the \n",
      "window, came and described her beauty. That is the cause \n",
      "for the laughter.  They were discussing if she was a \n",
      "Singhala girl, a Kalinga lady or perhaps a maid from \n",
      "Chera. You know that the ancestors of the Pazluvoor clan \n",
      "originally came here from the Chera country?\"\n",
      "\"I have heard it too. Perhaps you had told me ea rlier. \n",
      "That's OK! Kandamara, how long is it since Lord \n",
      "Pazluvoor married this mysterious beauty?\"\n",
      "\"It must be less than two years. He has not left her alone \n",
      "for even a short while from the time he married her! He \n",
      "takes his ladylove along wherever he goes;  in a closed \n",
      "palanquin! In fact there has been a lot of sniggering about \n",
      "it all over the country. Vandiya Deva, won't there be \n",
      "ridicule and derision if men who are past a certain age get \n",
      "involved in such entanglements with women?\"\n",
      "\"I do not think that is the reason. Kandamara, shall I tell \n",
      "you the real reason for the laughter? Generally women are \n",
      "envious. Don't think I am belittling the women in your \n",
      "family. All womankind is like that! The women of your \n",
      "household are dark-colored beauties. However, Lord \n",
      "Pazluvoor's beloved is rosily -fair and golden hued. That is \n",
      "why these women do not like her; they are making up \n",
      "stories about her...!\"\n",
      "\"Hey! What is this wonder? How do you know about her \n",
      "complexion? Why, have you seen her? Where? How did \n",
      "you see her? If Lord Pazluvoor knows of this, your life is \n",
      "not yours!\"\n",
      "\"Kandamara, I am not afraid of all that. You know it. \n",
      "Moreover, I have not done anything improper. I was \n",
      "watching, one among the crowd on the roadside, when \n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor and his retinue went past. The  elephant, \n",
      "horses, livery, footmen, drummers -- I believe all these \n",
      "were honors sent by your family to receive him. Is that \n",
      "true?\"\n",
      "\"Yes we had sent all those accolades. So what ...?\"\n",
      "\"So what? Nothing. I was just comparing the reception that \n",
      "you accorded to Lord Pazluvoor and the welcome given to \n",
      "me; nothing else ...\"\n",
      "Kandamaran laughed lightly, \"We gave him the tribute and \n",
      "honor due to the official who levies taxes. A welcome \n",
      "appropriate to a great warrior was given to you! Sometime, \n",
      "with God Muruga's grace, when you become the son -in-\n",
      "law to our house we shall give you the honors due to a \n",
      "bridegroom and welcome you.\" He then added, \"But, you were about to say something \n",
      "else; we were sidetracked. Oh yes! You were saying that \n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor's beloved was  very fair and light in color. \n",
      "How did you know that?\"\n",
      "\"Lord Pazluvoor was coming seated on the dark, huge \n",
      "elephant from Kadamboor Fort: like Yama, the God of \n",
      "Justice seated upon a huge water -buffalo! All my thoughts \n",
      "were concentrated on him. While I was building dream-\n",
      "empires about one day becoming famous and powerful like \n",
      "him, a covered palanquin followed him. Even as I \n",
      "wondered about who could come in a covered palanquin, a \n",
      "hand from inside parted the curtains. I could barely see the \n",
      "face within. The hand and face were golden -hued. That \n",
      "was all I saw. From what you said just now, I realize that \n",
      "she must be the beloved of Lord Pazluvoor.\"\n",
      "\"Vandiya Deva, you are a lucky fellow! It is being said \n",
      "that no man has glimpsed upon that Young -Queen of \n",
      "Pazluvoor. You could at least see her hand and face for a \n",
      "second. From what you saw, can you guess anything about \n",
      "the nation which gave birth to that beauty?\" asked \n",
      "Kandamaran.\n",
      "\"I did not ponder about it at that time. Now that I think of \n",
      "it, she is perhaps a woman f rom the Kashmir country; or \n",
      "she is a beauty who hails from the distant lands across the \n",
      "sea like Java, Kadaram (Malaya), Yavana (Greece -Rome). \n",
      "Maybe she is a princess from Arabia: I believe that women \n",
      "in that country are hidden behind veils from birth till\n",
      "death.\"\n",
      "At that moment, the sound of musical instruments could be \n",
      "heard somewhere nearby. Several kinds of drums, flutes, \n",
      "pipes and instruments like salli, karadi, parai, udukku  \n",
      "were being tuned together. \"What is that noise?\" asked \n",
      "Vallavarayan.\n",
      "\"The Kuravai Koothu (gypsy dance) is about to begin. The \n",
      "drums and flutes are being tuned in preparation. Would \n",
      "you like to watch the gypsy dance? Or, would you like to \n",
      "eat early and sleep well?\" \n",
      "Vandiya Devan recalled Azlvar -adiyan mentioning the \n",
      "gypsy dance. \"I have never seen the gypsy dance; I must \n",
      "surely see it,\" he said.\n",
      "When they walked ahead a little and turned, they could see \n",
      "the stage being set for the dancers. The guests were \n",
      "gathering in front of the stage. The stage for the gypsy \n",
      "dance was set in a wide courtyard spread with clean -white \n",
      "sand and situated in a spot surrounded by the palace walls \n",
      "and the towering battlements of the fort. The stage was \n",
      "decorated with colorful drawings of cocks, peacocks, \n",
      "swans and parrots. They had further decked the  stage with \n",
      "several fragrant flower garlands, red -rice popped white, \n",
      "colored millet, yellow turmeric and other powders, \n",
      "kunrimani (small red berry -beads), and other vivid \n",
      "decorations.  Tall oil-lamps and flaming torches tried to \n",
      "drive the darkness away. Bu t the swirling fragrance from 4smoldering frankincense and smokey torches created a \n",
      "misty screen dimming the lights.  The musicians sat on \n",
      "both sides and in front of the stage and played their \n",
      "instruments with gusto. The fragrant flowers, sweet \n",
      "smelling incense and the drum beats all together made \n",
      "Vandiya Devan feel light -headed.\n",
      "After all the important guests were seated, the nine \n",
      "maidens who were to perform the gypsy dance came on \n",
      "the stage. They wore the tight fitting clothes and \n",
      "ornaments suitable for d ancing; they had bell-filled anklets \n",
      "on their feet; brilliant red hued flowers of the hill country, \n",
      "flowers favored by the God Muruga, decorated their \n",
      "hairstyles. A long garland woven with such flowers thrown \n",
      "upon their shoulders, seemed to bind them to ea ch other as \n",
      "they stood upon the stage. In their hands they daintily \n",
      "grasped beautiful parrots made of sandalwood painted a \n",
      "vivid green.\n",
      "After greeting the audience they began to sing and dance. \n",
      "They first sang a few verses in praise of God Muruga. \n",
      "They sang of the brave deeds of Muruga; and they sang of \n",
      "his victorious spear which killed the demons Soora -padma \n",
      "and Gaja-mukha and then dried up the vast ocean. They \n",
      "sang of how he chose for his bride, a maid from the Tamil \n",
      "country, a gypsy maid from the hills who was guarding the \n",
      "millet fields, even as heavenly nymphs offered prayers to \n",
      "marry the young warrior -God. Their song celebrated the \n",
      "grace and benevolence of Velan, i.e., Murugan who bears \n",
      "the spear. The lyrical songs, the fast paced dance, the quick \n",
      "drum-beats, enchanting flute all in combination bewitched \n",
      "those who were watching. With the following words of \n",
      "prayer the dance concluded:\n",
      "Let hunger and disease be destroyed;Let enmity be routed;Let rain and fertility increase;Let bounty grow boundless.\n",
      "The maidens stepped off the stage and moved away.\n",
      "Next, a man and woman dressed as oracles -- thevar-aalan \n",
      "and thevar-aati,  came on stage. The divine -man and \n",
      "divine-woman wore blood-red clothes. They had brilliant \n",
      "garlands made of blood -red oleander flowers. They had \n",
      "painted their foreheads with bright red kumkum powders. \n",
      "Even their lips seemed blood -red because they had chewed \n",
      "the betel leaf and areca -nut. Their eyes seemed blood -shot! \n",
      "The Velan Attam or oracle dance, began calmly enough. \n",
      "They danced by themselves and with arms linked together. \n",
      "As time passed the tempo and passion increased. The \n",
      "divine-woman picked up a spear from the side. The man \n",
      "tried to pry it from her hands; and she would not let go. \n",
      "The dance became more frenzied: finally the man leaped \n",
      "across the resonating stage, jumping high, he plucked the \n",
      "spear from his companion. With an expression of fear on \n",
      "her face she moved away behind the screens.\n",
      "The divine-man now danced all by himself with more and \n",
      "more rapid movements. He acted the part of the God Velan killing the demon Soora. Soora's head was chopped off \n",
      "repeatedly. But the severed -head grew back again and \n",
      "again. Velan grew angrier and angrier as the head came \n",
      "back again and again. Sparks flew from his eyes. In the \n",
      "end Soora fell dead. Thevar-aalan threw his spear down.\n",
      "By now all musical instruments were quiet. Only the little \n",
      "hand-held drum, the udukku could be heard. A priest stood \n",
      "near the stage fanatically beating the hand -drum. Each part \n",
      "of Thevar-aalan's body shuddered. Thos e in the audience \n",
      "whispered to each other: \"The spirit has materialized.\" \n",
      "Soon the priest looked at the frenzied Thevar -aalan and \n",
      "said, \"Vela! Muruga! Commander of the Gods! Lord who \n",
      "killed Soora! Please reveal your divine predictions to us, \n",
      "your devotees.\"\n",
      "\"Ask fellow! Ask whatever you want! I will reveal all!\" \n",
      "replied the delirious man. \"Will the rains be good? Shall \n",
      "we have plenty of water? Will the land be bountiful? Will \n",
      "our desires be fulfilled?\" asked the priest.\n",
      "\"The rains will be in season. The  waters would be \n",
      "abundant. The land will be fruitful and desires will be \n",
      "fulfilled! But you have not made offerings to my Mother! \n",
      "The Goddess desires a sacrifice. The Mother -Goddess \n",
      "wants a sacrifice!\" shouted the dancer in delirium.\n",
      "\"What sacrifice?\" asked the priest.\n",
      "\"Will it be offered if I ask?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, we will offer it. We shall surely offer the sacrifice.\"\n",
      "\"She wants the blood of royalty! She thirsts for the blood \n",
      "of a prince from a thousand year -old dynasty!\" shouted the \n",
      "frenzied dancer in a horrib le voice. \n",
      "The dignitaries seated in front of the stage -- Lord \n",
      "Pazluvoor, Lord of Mazluvoor, Lord Sambuvaraya and \n",
      "others, they looked at each other. Their eyes seemed to talk \n",
      "a secret language. Lord Sambuvaraya seemed to make a \n",
      "sign to the priest.\n",
      "The priest stopped beating his hand -drum. The dancer \n",
      "dropped upon the stage like a felled tree. The woman \n",
      "dancer ran in to help him out. The audience dispersed \n",
      "silently. Somewhere outside, the howling of wolves could \n",
      "be heard.\n",
      "Vandiya Devan, who had been watch ing all this with some \n",
      "agitation, looked towards the direction in which the \n",
      "howling wolves were heard. There, atop the outer ramparts \n",
      "of the fortress, he saw a head! \n",
      "It was Azlvar-adiyan's head. For a second he was subject \n",
      "to a horrifying feeling. It app eared as if the severed head of \n",
      "Azlvar-adiyan had been placed upon those walls. He \n",
      "blinked his eyelids to look again: the head was no longer \n",
      "there! He felt ashamed about the worthless fear that had 5taken hold of him. Several other emotions beyond his \n",
      "experience seemed to agitate his thoughts.\n",

      "Chapter 6 -- Midnight Meeting\n",
      "After the gypsy dance and the oracle dance, there was a \n",
      "lavish feast for the guests. Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan \n",
      "could not enjoy the banquet. His body was tired an d his \n",
      "mind was agitated. His friend Kandamaran, seated next to \n",
      "him, pointed out the several dignitaries with pride.\n",
      "Besides Lord Pazluvoor and Lord Sambuvaraya, there was \n",
      "Thennavan Mazlava-raya Lord of Mazlapadi Mazluvoor; \n",
      "The Elder and largest land -holder of Kunratoor had come; \n",

      "Kolli Hills-- all these men were there at the banquet. \n",
      "Kandamaran whispered their names into Vandiya Devan's \n",
      "ears and pointed them out discretely.\n",
      "These dignitaries were not ordinary men; nor was it \n",
      "common to see them all assembled together in one place \n",
      "like this. Each of them was a territorial chieftain; or they \n",
      "had earned the distinction of territorial chieftains because \n",
      "of their bravery. In those days, the title araya or raya which \n",
      "was derived from the sanskrit word raja or Tamil word \n",
      "arasa (meaning king) denoted  nobility or royalty. \n",
      "Territorial chieftains and noblemen of equal rank were \n",
      "entitled to add the suffix rayan or arayan to their names. \n",
      "They were also called by the name of their town with the \n",
      "added title. (In fact our hero Vandiya Devan bore the name \n",
      "Vallava-rayan because he was born in the noble family of \n",
      "Vallam.)\n",
      "But, these chieftains did not bear their titles merely \n",
      "because of their noble birth and thereby enjoy the comforts \n",
      "and indulgence of palace life. Only those men who were \n",
      "able-bodied and brave enough to enter the battle -field \n",
      "could safeguard their titles and territories. Therefore, each \n",
      "of these men had not only participated in several \n",
      "campaigns but they also bore the wounds of such warfare \n",
      "on their bodies. Now, all these men governed their \n",

      "men gathered together here? The question occurred to him \n",
      "again and again. All sorts of garbled doubts filled his \n",
      "mind. With his mind filled with such confusion, he sought his \n",
      "bed in the isolated spot re adied by Kandamaran for him. \n",
      "Because the palace was hosting several important \n",
      "dignitaries, a tiny, covered terrace was allotted to him as a \n",
      "bed-chamber. \n",
      "\"You seem to be very tired. Lie down and sleep well. I will \n",
      "take care of the other guests and later c ome to sleep in this \n",
      "terrace itself,\" said Kandamaran before going away.\n",
      "As soon as he lay down, sleep swirled into Vandiya \n",
      "Devan's eyes. Nitra Devi, the Goddess of Sleep took hold \n",
      "of him completely. But what use? There is Mind which \n",
      "cannot be conquered even by the Goddess of Sleep! Even \n",
      "though his body remained still and his eyes stayed tightly \n",
      "shut, thoughts buried deep in the mind blossomed into \n",
      "dreams. Several meaningless incidents, happenings beyond \n",
      "reason took place in that dream world. \n",
      "Somewhere in the distance a lone wolf howled. One wolf \n",
      "became ten wolves; hundred wolves; they all howled \n",
      "together. While howling they came nearer and nearer and \n",
      "nearer. In that pitch darkness their eyes burned like tiny \n",
      "embers. They came closer and closer. Vandiya D evan tried \n",
      "to turn around and run away to escape. But, on the other \n",
      "side there were tens, hundreds, no thousands of dogs --\n",
      "barking loudly, rushing towards him. The eyes of those \n",
      "hunting dogs glowed like embers. What will happen to me \n",
      "if I am caught in between these mad dogs and wolves? \n",
      "thought Vandiya Devan and shivered. \n",
      "Luckily there was a temple right in front. He ran into the \n",
      "temple and pulled the door shut, bolting it hurriedly. When \n",
      "he looked around it seemed to be a temple of the Mother \n",
      "Goddess. A statue of Kali stood there with a horrible face \n",
      "and tongue hanging out.  A priest rose from behind the \n",
      "statue. He held a terrible machete in his hands. \"Oh! You \n",
      "have come,\" he said as he came closer and closer.\n",
      "\"What is the history of your noble family? F or how many \n",
      "generations have your clansmen ruled their kingdom? Tell \n",
      "the truth!\" said the priest.\n",
      "\"The Vallava Rayas of the Vaanar family had ruled for \n",
      "three hundred years. During my father's times we lost all \n",
      "our lands to the Vaithumba kings,\" replied Va ndiya Devan. \n",
      "\"Then you are not the right sacrifice. Run away,\" said the \n",
      "priest with disgust. \n",
      "Suddenly Kali turned into a statue of Krishna! Two \n",
      "delightful maidens came in, singing the psalms of Saint \n",
      "Andal and danced with abandon in front of the statue. \n",
      "While he was enchanted with these sights, he heard the \n",
      "song \"We saw, we saw, we saw things pleasing to the eye,\" \n",
      "behind him. Turning around he saw Azlvar -adiyan Nambi. \n",
      "Yes it was him singing. Oh no. Not him; it was just his \n",
      "head that sang. The severed head  was placed on the \n",
      "sacrificial alter! 6Unable to bear this sight, Vandiya Devan turned away. \n",
      "Upon turning, he banged his head upon the pillar. The \n",
      "dream melted away. Eyes opened. But he saw a sight that \n",
      "seemed to mix reality with dreams.\n",
      "In a spot directly in front of his terrace, he could see the \n",
      "fortress walls of Kadamboor palace; he could see a head \n",
      "on top of these walls. It was the head of that very same \n",
      "Azlvar-adiyan Nambi. This time he realized that it was \n",
      "neither a dream nor a hallucination. Becaus e, however \n",
      "long he stared at it, the head remained there. It was not \n",
      "merely a head, there was a body behind it. He could easily \n",
      "detect both hands of Azlvar -adiyan holding on to the wall. \n",
      "In addition, the fellow was staring rather intensely at \n",
      "something below, inside the wall. \n",
      "What is he looking at so earnestly, inside there? ... There is \n",
      "some kind of deception and intrigue in this. Azlvar -adiyan \n",
      "could not have come here with good intentions. He must \n",
      "have come here with vile plans to perform some evil deed . \n",
      "Is it not my duty, being Kandamaran's dearest friend, to \n",
      "stop this wickedness? How can I sleep in idleness without \n",
      "guarding the house of these folks who have fed and housed \n",
      "me tonight? Vallavarayan jumped up. He picked up a knife \n",
      "in its sheath lying on h is side and stuck it in his waist -\n",
      "band. He walked towards the direction in which he saw \n",
      "Nambi's head.\n",
      "Remember, he was sleeping in a corner of the upper \n",
      "terrace? From there as he walked towards the outer walls \n",
      "of the palace, he had to go around several tu rrets, pillars \n",
      "and decorative rooftops. After walking on for a while he \n",
      "suddenly heard the sound of voices talking somewhere \n",
      "nearby. He hesitated. Hiding himself behind a pillar he \n",
      "peeped down below. \n",
      "In a narrow courtyard enclosed by tall walls he saw ab out \n",
      "ten or twelve men seated comfortably. The towering walls \n",
      "hid the rising moonlight. However, an iron oil -lamp buried \n",
      "in the wall gave some light. All the men seated there were \n",
      "the dignitaries he had met at the banquet earlier; the \n",
      "chieftains and elder officials of the Chozla Empire. \n",
      "They must have gathered in this midnight conference to \n",
      "discuss some important matter. Azlvar -adiyan must be \n",
      "trying to spy upon what they were saying and doing, by \n",
      "hanging on the outer walls. There is no doubt about the \n",
      "fact that Azlvar-adiyan is a very shrewd and clever fellow. \n",
      "From where he was positioned on the wall, Azlvar -adiyan \n",
      "could more or less see all the men seated in conference \n",
      "below. He could hear their talk very well. But the men \n",
      "seated there  could not see Azlva r-adiyan. The courtyard \n",
      "and palace wall were situated in that fashion! Somehow, \n",
      "the fellow had chanced upon such a perfect spot. \n",
      "Capable fellow. No doubt!  But all his cleverness will not \n",
      "work with this Vandiya Devan of the Vaanar clan. \n",
      "Somehow, I must get hold of that masquerading Vaishnava \n",
      "fanatic .... but if I am to catch him, I cannot do so without \n",
      "attracting the attention of the men assembled below. I have to cross the courtyard before I can reach those walls. There \n",
      "may be some danger in crossing the  courtyard in full view \n",
      "of those men.\n",
      "He recalled the words of Sambuvaraya saying \"He need \n",
      "not have come here, today of all days.\" \n",
      "These men are gathered here to discuss something \n",
      "important. It is clear that they do not want anyone to know \n",
      "what their discussions are about. In such a situation if they \n",
      "suddenly see me, they will start suspecting me. By the time \n",
      "I explain about Azlvar-adiyan he would have jumped off \n",
      "the wall and escaped. All that will remain is the doubt \n",
      "about me. If they ask, \"Why did you,  who were supposed \n",
      "to be sleeping, come here?\" what can I reply? I will \n",
      "definitely put Kandamaran in a delicate position. There! \n",
      "Even Kandamaran is part of this meeting; he is seated at \n",
      "the back. If I ask him in the morning I can know all.\n",
      "As these thoughts ran through his mind, Vandiya Devan \n",
      "saw a covered palanquin resting in one corner of the \n",
      "courtyard below him. Is this not the same palanquin that \n",
      "came behind Lord Pazluvoor and his elephant?  That lady \n",
      "who was in it, who parted the curtains to peep outs ide, I \n",
      "wonder where she is now. I believe the old man did not \n",
      "even send her to the women's apartments. This is the \n",
      "predicament if somewhat older men marry very young \n",
      "girls. Suspicion drains their very life. They cannot bear to \n",
      "be parted from their young wi ves even for one moment! \n",
      "Perhaps even now, Pazluvoor's Young -Queen is in this \n",
      "palanquin! Gosh! Look at the fate of this great warrior! At \n",
      "this age, he is enslaved by a slip of a girl and is on tender -\n",
      "hooks. She is not all that great a Rathi, Menaka or Ramb a \n",
      "(heavenly beauties). \n",
      "No, Vandiya Devan had not forgotten the feeling of \n",
      "distaste which he experienced when he had seen her by the \n",
      "roadside. I wonder what this brave Lord Pazluvoor sees in \n",
      "her?  More surprising is this Azlvar -adiyan's madness. \n",
      "Maybe he is waiting on that wall because this palanquin is \n",
      "here. What is the relationship between him and her? How \n",
      "can I know?  Perhaps she is his sister; or maybe his \n",
      "sweetheart. Maybe Lord Pazluvoor forcefully abducted \n",
      "her. He is capable of doing such things. May be this fellow \n",
      "is wandering around trying to find an opportunity to meet \n",
      "her and talk to her. Why should I bother about all this. Let \n",
      "me go back to sleep, thought Vandiya Devan.\n",
      "Just as he made this decision he heard his name being \n",
      "uttered down below. Imm ediately he began to listen with \n",
      "some interest.\n",
      "\"That fellow who came in saying that he was a friend of \n",
      "your son? Where is he sleeping? He should not hear \n",
      "anything that we utter here. Remember that he serves the \n",
      "Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Armies. Till all our \n",
      "plans are complete and the time for action arrives, no one \n",
      "should know about our plans. Even if there is the slightest \n",
      "suspicion that this fellow knows something, he must not be 7let outside this fortress. In fact it would be better to put a \n",
      "complete end to his activities ...\"\n",
      "Our readers can guess how Vandiya Devan felt upon \n",
      "hearing these words. But he did not move away from the \n",
      "spot. He made up his mind to listen to all their talk.\n",
      "Who was the Northern Commander -in-Chief? It was none \n",
      "other than the eldest son of Emperor Sundara Chozla. \n",
      "None other than the Crown Prince, next in line for the \n",
      "throne. Why should these fellows object to my serving that \n",
      "Prince? What is it that they are planning that must be kept \n",
      "secret from the Prince?'\n",
      "At that moment Kandamaran intervened for his friend: \n",
      "\"Vandiya Devan is sleeping peacefully in the corner \n",
      "terrace. He cannot hear the discussions in this meeting. He \n",
      "will not interfere in things that do not concern him. Even if \n",
      "he hears something he will not hinder y our plans in any \n",
      "way. I will be responsible for that.\"\n",
      "\"I am happy that you trust him so much. But none of us \n",
      "know of him or his credentials. That is why I warned you. \n",
      "What we are going to discuss now is about the rights of \n",
      "succession to a large empire. E ven if one whisper gets out \n",
      "because of carelessness it may lead to severe \n",
      "consequences. All of you must remember this,\" said Lord \n",
      "Pazluvoor.\n",
      "*****\n",
      "Ponniyin Selvan\n",
      "Chapter 7 -- Laughter And Hatred\n",
      "Vandiya Devan made up his mind as soon as he heard the \n",
      "words `Right to the empire' uttered by Lord Pazluvoor. \n",
      "What are these men going to say about the rights to \n",
      "succession? Who are they to discuss it? I must definitely \n",
      "find out what is happening here. I better sit right here; \n",
      "there cannot be a more convenient h iding spot. Let the \n",
      "Nambi go do what he wants. Why should I bother about \n",
      "him?\n",
      "Vandiya Devan had surmised earlier that something \n",
      "mysterious was taking place in that palace.  The cryptic \n",
      "words of Azlvar-adiyan, the arrogant behavior of the gate -\n",
      "keepers, the frightening words of the frenzied soothsayer --\n",
      "all these had raised several doubts. Here was an \n",
      "opportunity to clear all those apprehensions! Why not \n",
      "utilize the heaven sent chance?\n",
      "Well! Even Kandamaran, who I considered a dear friend, \n",
      "has not told the truth. He sent me to bed and has come to \n",
      "this secret midnight-meeting. I must not let him off easily \n",
      "tomorrow!\n",
      "By now, Lord Pazluvoor had started talking. Vandiya \n",
      "Devan listened carefully. \"I am here to announce a very \n",
      "grave news to you all. That is why Sambuvaraya has convened this meeting. Right now, the health of Emperor \n",
      "Sundara Chozla, is cause for great concern. I have secretly \n",
      "asked the palace Doctors: they have said `There is not \n",
      "much hope now. He is not likely to live much longer.'  \n",
      "Therefore, we have to decide upon the next course of \n",
      "action.\"  So said Lord Pazluvoor.\n",
      "\"What have the astrologers said?\" asked one of the men.\n",
      "Another replied \"Why ask the astrologers? Hasn't the long -\n",

      "several days? Is that not enough?\"\n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor replied to this: \"We have consulted the \n",
      "astrologers also. They postpone the time a little. That is all. \n",
      "Anyway, we have to now think about who is eligible to \n",
      "succeed to the throne ...\"\n",
      "\"What is left to think about now?   Was not Aditya \n",
      "Karikala coronated as the Crown Prince two years ago \n",
      "itself?\" declared a hoarse voice.\n",
      "\"True. But I would like to know if any one of us was \n",
      "consulted before the coronation took place. Each one of us \n",
      "gathered here belongs to well establish ed clans that have \n",
      "strived for more than a hundred years, for more than four \n",
      "generations, to acquire the eminence of this Chozla \n",
      "Empire. My great-grandfather died in the battle of Thiru -\n",
      "puram-biyam. My grandfather lost his life during the war \n",
      "in Vellur. My father sacrificed his life at Takkolam. In a \n",
      "similar fashion, ancestors to each of you have given their \n",
      "lives to establish the greatness of this Chozla Empire. \n",
      "Young men from our families have died in the battlefield. \n",
      "Even today, sons from our family and clan are engaged in \n",
      "warfare in Lanka.  But the Emperor did not consult our \n",
      "opinion for the decision about a successor to the throne. \n",
      "Even Emperor Dasaratha of the Epic convened an \n",
      "assembly of his advisors before deciding to crown Lord \n",
      "Rama as the Crown Pri nce; he consulted his ministers, \n",
      "advisors, army commanders  and chieftains under him.  \n",
      "But, our Sundara Chozla did not consider it necessary to \n",
      "consult anyone  ...\"\n",
      "\"It is correct to say that he did not consult any of us. \n",
      "However, it is not accurate when the Lord of Taxes says \n",
      "that the emperor did not consult anyone! The opinions of \n",
      "the Elder Pirati Sembiyan Madevi and that of the Younger \n",
      "Pirati Kundavai Devi were asked for. Can Lord Pazluvoor \n",
      "deny this?\"  When a member asked this in a mocking \n",
      "voice, some others of the group laughed.\n",
      "\"Well! You all laugh! I do not know how you can think of \n",
      "laughter. My very heart burns when I think of it; my blood \n",
      "boils. I wonder why I should safeguard my life and live \n",
      "without any sense of shame. The soothsayer who danced in \n",
      "frenzy said that the Goddess is asking for a sacrifice. He \n",
      "asked for a human sacrifice; of a prince from a thousand -\n",
      "year old dynasty. Give me up as the sacrifice. My family is \n",
      "more ancient than a thousand years. With a blow across \n",
      "my throat, each of you with your swords offer me as the 8sacrifice. The Mother Goddess will be satisfied; my soul \n",
      "will be satisfied.\"\n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor spoke the above words with as much rage \n",
      "as the frenzied soothsaying -dancer.\n",
      "Silence prevailed for a short while. The whistling o f the \n",
      "western breeze and the whispering of the trees near the \n",
      "wall were the only sounds.\n",
      "\"I beg for the patience and forgiveness of the Pazluvoor \n",
      "King for having uttered some words in ignorance and the \n",
      "thoughtless laughter that followed. You are our leade r \n",
      "without any equal. We here, are all ready to carry out any \n",
      "of your commands. We will walk in the path you direct us. \n",
      "Please grant forgiveness,\" spoke an emotional \n",
      "Sambuvaraya.\n",
      "\"I too lost my composure. You should forgive me. Think \n",
      "of one thing. Two hund red years before today, Vijayala \n",
      "Chozla broke the power of the Muthuaraya kings and \n",
      "captured Tanjore. During the battle of Thiru -puram-biyam, \n",
      "he helped the Pallava army and destroyed the legions of \n",
      "Madurai Pandiya. From that moment, the Chozla Kingdom \n",
      "has been growing and expanding day -by-day. The Chozla's \n",
      "had not acquired this greatness even during the times of \n",
      "historic Karikala Valava who built the embankments for \n",
      "the Cauvery.  Today, the empire spreads from Cape \n",
      "Comorin in the south to the Thungabadra -Krishna rivers in \n",
      "the north. The Pandiya Kingdom, Nanjil Kingdom, the \n",
      "Chera Kingdom which has not been subjugated by anyone \n",
      "so far, Thondai Territories, Paagi, Gangapadi, Nulampadi, \n",

      "The Chozla tiger-flag flies in all these countries. By now, \n",
      "even Lanka in the south as well as Vengi and Rashtrakuta \n",
      "in the north should have come under ou r sway. I do not \n",
      "have to give you the reasons for them not being \n",
      "vanquished; you know the reasons ....\"\n",
      "Lord Mazluvoor intervened: \"Yes. All of us know the \n",
      "reason. There are two reasons for Lanka, Vengi, Kalinga \n",
      "and Rashtrakuta not coming under our suzera inty. One \n",
      "cause is the Northern Commander -in-Chief, Prince Aditya \n",
      "Karikala; the other is the Commander of the Southern \n",
      "Armies, Arulmozli Varma.\"\n",
      "\"I agree with the reasons given by Lord Mazluvoor. For \n",
      "the last hundred years the practice for appointing a \n",
      "commander in the Chozla Kingdom was different. Brave \n",
      "warriors, with the experience of several campaigns would \n",
      "be selected as Generals of the army and as Commanders -\n",
      "in-Chief. But what has happened today? The elder Prince \n",
      "is a commander for the northern armies . What is he doing? \n",
      "He is not planning campaigns against the twin territories of \n",
      "the Rashtrakutas or against Vengi (modern Eluru of \n",
      "Andhra) in the northeast. He sits in Kanchi, building a \n",
      "Golden Palace! I ask you, the bravest warriors born in the \n",
      "best of clans: till now, has any king in the Tamil Nation built a Golden Palace for his own dwelling?  Even the \n",
      "most famous Emperor Paranthaka, who conquered \n",
      "Madurai and Lanka and is now in his heavenly abode, did \n",
      "not build himself a Golden Palace. He merely covere d the \n",
      "roof of the temple in Chidambaram with gold. But Prince \n",
      "Aditya Karikala builds himself a Golden Palace in Kanchi, \n",
      "for his residence!  Apparently, the huge palaces from \n",
      "which great Pallava monarchs ruled their empires for \n",
      "several generations, are not adequate for the prestige of our \n",
      "Prince! He builds a Golden Palace!  He embeds rubies and \n",
      "diamonds in the walls of that palace. Not a copper coin \n",
      "from all the treasures captured from our campaigns in the \n",

      "earlier, the Emperor has lost the capability of thinking for \n",
      "himself. Neither does he ask our opinion on important \n",

      "\"If so, I request Lord Pazluvoor to clear just one more \n",

      "him: if the words of the palace doctors' come true, if the omens forecast by the comet appearing in the sky come \n",
      "true -- we have to decide who is eligible to succeed to the \n",
      "Chozla throne.\"\n",
      "\"We request that you state your opinion on this matter. \n",
      "There is no one here who has anything to say against your \n",

      "\"That is not correct. Each one of you must think and then \n",
      "express an impartial opinion. Permit me to recall some old \n",
      "history to your memories.  Twenty -four years ago, King \n",
      "Gandara Aditya who was a great philosopher and devout \n",
      "soul, died unexpectedly. When he died, his son, \n",
      "Madurandaka, was a one year old child. The Queen -\n",
      "consort of Gandara Aditya, the Lady Sembiyan Madevi, \n",
      "announced to us, the wishes of the King: his younger \n",
      "brother Arinjaya was to accept the Chozla throne after \n",
      "him. Therefore, we crowned Prince Arinjaya as the Chozla \n",
      "monarch. However, fate did not decree that Arinjaya \n",
      "should sit on the throne for more than a year. When \n",
      "Arinjaya died,  his son, Paranth aka Sundara Chozla, was a \n",
      "youth of twenty-four. Considering the welfare of the \n",
      "nation, all of us -- the ministers, advisors, territorial \n",
      "chieftains the heads of all the clans and leaders of the cities \n",
      "and districts -- decided unanimously, and crowned Sunda ra \n",
      "Chozla. None of us had cause to regret this. Because, until \n",
      "two years ago, he ruled the nation with justice; he \n",
      "respected our wishes and opinions and ruled this country \n",
      "lawfully. Because of him the Chozla power grew to \n",
      "include all neighboring nations un der its sway. \n",
      "\"Now, the health of Sundara Chozla is cause for concern. \n",
      "In this situation, who is eligible to succeed the Emperor? \n",
      "Madurandaka, the cherished son of King Gandara Aditya, \n",
      "is now grown up; he has the intelligence, education, the \n",
      "character, the devotion to God, all the qualities of a person \n",
      "worthy of the throne. Sundara Chozla's son, Aditya \n",
      "Karikala, who is younger to him by one year, is stationed \n",
      "in Kanchi as a Commander -in-Chief. Who between these \n",
      "two has the right to succeed to the throne? What is the \n",
      "code of inheritance among the clans? What is the law? \n",
      "What is the ancient tradition of the Tamils? Is it justice if \n",
      "the elder brother's son, Madurandaka inherits the nation? \n",
      "Or, is it legal for the grand -son of the younger brother to \n",
      "succeed? Each of you must consider this and clearly state \n",
      "your decision.\"\n",
      "\"Madurandaka, the son of the elder brother Gandara \n",

      "\"I agree\", \"That is my opinion too,\" so rose se veral voices. \n",
      "\"Your convictions are mine. Madurandaka deserves the \n",
      "throne. However, is everyone here ready to support and \n",
      "further this belief? Are you all ready to sacrifice your lives, \n",
      "your wealth and very soul for this cause? This very minute, \n",
      "are you all ready to swear in the name of Goddess Durga \n",
      "and take an oath of allegiance?\"  When Lord Pazluvoor 1asked this question his voice had a certain harshness, not \n",
      "heard till then.\n",
      "Silence prevailed for some time.  Lord Sambuvaraya then \n",
      "said, \"We are ready to take such an oath of support.  \n",
      "Before that, we need one clarification. What are the \n",
      "feelings of Prince Madurandaka? Is he ready to accept the \n",
      "throne and rule this Empire? We have heard that the \n",
      "cherished son of Gandara Aditya has forsaken the \n",
      "pleasures of worldly life and is fully involved in the \n",
      "devotion and worship of God Shiva. Several persons have \n",
      "said that he has no interest in worldly kingdoms. We have \n",
      "also heard that his mother, the Elder Pirati Sembiyan \n",
      "Madevi is totally opposed to his ascending t he throne. We \n",
      "wish to know the truth about this from you.\"\n",
      "\"A good point and you raised it at the correct time. I must \n",
      "clarify this question. I should have explained earlier --\n",
      "forgive me for not doing so,\" with this long introduction \n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor spoke as follows: \"The whole nation \n",
      "knows that the Lady Sembiyan Madevi discouraged her \n",
      "only son from having any interest in affairs of the state and \n",
      "raised him as a Saiva ascetic. But, neither nation nor \n",
      "people know the reason behind such behavior.  The Elder \n",
      "Pirati feared that his very life would be in danger if her son \n",
      "Madurandaka had any wish to rule the empire ... \"\n",
      "\"Aha! Is that so!\"\n",
      "\"Yes! To any mother, the wish  that the son to whom she \n",
      "gave birth should stay well and alive is greater than a \n",
      "desire that he should sit upon the throne of the Kingdom. \n",
      "Young Prince Madurandaka, who considered the words of \n",
      "his mother as gospel, turned his mind in the path of \n",
      "devotion and asceticism. Nevertheless, for sometime, his \n",
      "mind has slowly undergone some transformatio n. `This \n",
      "Chozla Empire is mine; it is my duty to rule the nation!' \n",
      "such thoughts have taken root and grown in his heart. If he \n",
      "knows that all of you are ready to support his cause, he is \n",
      "ready to come forward at a suitable time and openly \n",
      "declare his intentions.\" \n",
      "\"What proof do we have for this?\"\n",
      "\"I will, without delay, produce proof that will satisfy all of \n",
      "you. If I furnish such proof, will each of you take an oath \n",
      "of allegiance to this cause?\"\n",
      "Several of the men said \"We will! We will!\"\n",
      "\"I hope no one has any other kind of reservation?\"\n",
      "\"No! None!\"\n",
      "\"Then, I shall show proof. I shall also clear the doubts \n",
      "raised by Lord Vananga -mudi Munai Raya.\" With this \n",
      "declaration, Lord Pazluvoor rose from his seat. Walking \n",
      "majestically, he neared the closed pala nquin. \"Prince! Please part the curtains and grace the outside with \n",
      "your appearance. Permit these brave warriors, who are \n",
      "ready to sacrifice their very life, wealth and soul for you, \n",
      "to gaze upon your face.\" Lord Pazluvoor spoke in a very \n",
      "deferential voice.\n",
      "Vandiya Devan, who was sitting behind the pillar on the \n",
      "upper terrace and listening to all these discussions with an \n",
      "overpowering curiosity, now peeped down carefully. As \n",
      "before, a hand parted the curtains of the palanquin. It too \n",
      "was a golden hand. It seemed to be the very same fair hand \n",
      "he had seen once before. But he now realized that he had \n",
      "surmised the golden bracelet worn by royalty to be a \n",
      "bangle. A dazzling face, comparable to the full moon, \n",
      "could be seen the very next instant. A handsome figu re, \n",
      "comparable to Manmatha, the God of Love, stepped out of \n",
      "the palanquin and smiled. \n",
      "Aha! Is this Prince Madurandaka, son of Gandara Aditya \n",
      "Deva?  I mistook him to be a woman? I concluded that it \n",
      "must be a girl, because of the closed palanquin!?  But, d id \n",
      "Azlvar-adiyan Nambi also make the same mistake?  \n",
      "Vandiya Devan looked around to see if Nambi was still \n",
      "thrusting his head above the wall. That spot of the palace \n",
      "wall was now shrouded by shadows cast by the trees. He \n",
      "could see nothing.\n",
      "By now he heard some shouts from below. \"Long Live \n",
      "Madurandaka! Praise the Crown -Prince Madurandaka! \n",
      "Victory to our brave spears!\" They were passionate \n",
      "outbursts. Vandiya Devan saw that all the men in the \n",
      "courtyard were now standing; they held their swords and \n",
      "spears high up above their heads and cheered. Thinking \n",
      "that it would be dangerous to remain any longer in that \n",
      "spot, he turned around and hurried back to his terrace and \n",
      "laid himself down.\n",

      "Chapter 9 -- Wayside Chitchat\n",
      "Vandiya Devan had spent  all his life until that day, in the \n",
      "dry lands north of the River Palar. Consequently, he did \n",
      "not know how to swim in a flowing river. Once, when he \n",
      "was in the army on border patrol along the banks of the \n",
      "North Pennar, he waded into the river for a bath. H e was \n",
      "caught in a swollen whirlpool. That sinister and devilish \n",
      "whirlpool made him go round and round. At the same time \n",
      "it dragged him downwards. Very soon the whirlpool had \n",
      "drained all his strength. I cannot escape now; I have to \n",
      "drown in this whirlpool a nd die! -- just as he lost hope he \n",
      "was thrown out, by God's grace. The waves threw him on \n",
      "the shores and saved him.\n",
      "When he went back to bed that night in Kadamboor, he \n",
      "experienced the same feeling he had while caught in the \n",
      "whirlpool.  He felt that with no choosing of his own, he 2had fallen into the huge whirlpool of a political conspiracy. \n",
      "Could he escape from this swirling treachery just as he had \n",
      "escaped from that whirlpool?\n",
      "The information he had gleaned from the midnight \n",
      "meeting at Kadamboor baffled  him. The dangers from \n",
      "external enemies to the Chozla Empire had been overcome \n",
      "only a few years ago. Prince Aditya Karikala -- brave, \n",
      "expert in warfare, a veritable Chanakya in politics; with his \n",
      "intelligence and optimum use of the capable Chozla \n",
      "armies, he routed the powers of the Rashtrakuta monarch, \n",
      "King Krishna, from the Thondai lands. In a way the \n",
      "external enemies were destroyed. Now, internal disruption \n",
      "and intrigue were raising their head. What would be the \n",
      "consequence of this internal discord which is more \n",
      "dangerous than external strife?\n",
      "Are not the important officials,  ministers, chieftains and \n",
      "famous warriors of the Chozla nation involved in this \n",
      "frightening endeavor? What kind of persons are the Lord \n",
      "of Pazluvoor and his brother? What is their p ower? How \n",
      "much prestige do they have? What about the others who \n",
      "met here today? They are all powerful, distinguished and \n",
      "eminent personalities. Is this the first meeting of this kind?  \n",
      "I wonder; to how many other places has the Prince been \n",
      "taken in a closed palanquin by Lord Pazluvoor? Aha! The \n",
      "fact of being married to a young girl in his old age has \n",
      "served him so usefully in this conspiracy!\n",
      "Until that day, no doubt about Prince Karikala's eligibility \n",
      "to the Chozla throne had risen in Vandiya Devan's mind . \n",
      "He had not even dreamed that a challenge would arise. Of \n",
      "course, he had heard of Madurandaka, the son of King \n",
      "Gandara Aditya. He had heard that, like the father the son \n",
      "was an ardent worshipper of God Shiva. But he had never \n",
      "heard anything about his righ ts to the succession or that he \n",
      "would demand his rights. In fact Vandiya Devan had never \n",
      "thought about such things.\n",
      "What is the legality, the justice? Who is truly eligible to \n",
      "succeed to the throne? Karikala? Madurandaka?  The more \n",
      "he thought about it, he felt that both sides had equal \n",
      "justification. If it really comes to a confrontation, who will \n",
      "come out victorious? What is my duty in this situation? \n",
      "Aha! I started on this journey from Kanchi while building \n",
      "all sorts of dream fortresses. I desired to att ain eminent \n",
      "positions in the Chozla Empire by pleasing the Crown \n",
      "Prince Karikala! I even hoped that in due course I would \n",
      "regain the ancestral territories of my Vaanar clan. The very \n",
      "limb that I caught hold of, to achieve all these dreams, \n",
      "seems ready to drop! ... Thinking of all such things when \n",
      "he came to bed the second time that night, Vandiya Devan \n",
      "suffered with sleeplessness for a long time. In the end, \n",
      "towards the late hours of the night just as the eastern skies \n",
      "were turning light, he somehow went to  sleep. \n",
      "The next morning, Vandiya Devan did not get up even \n",
      "when the golden-red rays of the rising sun fell piercingly \n",
      "upon him. He was jolted awake when Kandamaran came \n",

      "he added, \"After all my other guests had gone to sleep, I \n",

      "must be several hours past sunrise. I have to start \n",
      "immediately. Kandamara, tell your servants to get my \n",
      "horse ready.\"\n",
      "\"This is really fine! How can you leave so soon? What is \n",
      "the hurry? You must stay here for at least ten days before \n",
      "you go on,\" said Kandamaran.\n",
      "\"No, my dear fellow! I had news that my uncle in Tanjore \n",
      "was in a bad  shape; his survival itself is doubtful. I have to \n",
      "go quickly to see him before he is gone. I must leave \n",
      "immediately.\" Vandiya Devan said this with total \n",
      "conviction, without any hesitation.\n",

      "back.\"\n",
      "\"Why not? We shall think of it at that time. Permit  me to \n",

      "\"How can you do that? You have all sorts of important \n",
      "guests. How can you leave them and ...\"\n",
      "\"I have no guest more important than you ...\" saying this \n",
      "Kandamaran stopped suddenly. \"Yes the guests are \n",
      "important people. But my father can take care of them. The \n",
      "other officials of this palace can do that. I could not chat \n",
      "with you even last night. I can rest in peace on ly if I \n",

      "horses cantered quite slowly. The ride was rather pleasant. \n",
      "The friends did not seem to mind even the road dust \n",
      "sprayed upon them by the swift northern wind. They had \n",
      "lost themselves in old remembrances. After some tim e \n",
      "Vandiya Devan said: \"Kandamara! Even though I spent \n",
      "just one night in your house, it was very useful to me. Just \n",
      "one disappointment. You used to recount all sorts of things \n",
      "about your sister, while we were on the banks of the North \n",
      "Pennar. I could not even see her properly! When she \n",
      "peeped from hiding behind your mother, I could glimpse \n",
      "about one-eighth of her face! Your sister seems to possess 3a shyness and modesty that is more than any one girl's \n",
      "share.\"\n",
      "Kandamaran's lips twitched as if to say somethin g. But no \n",
      "words came out.\n",
      "\"Still, no regrets. You have invited me to stay with you for \n",
      "a few days on my way back. I can make her acquaintance \n",
      "at that time. By that time your younger sister may be able \n",
      "to overcome her shyness about me. Kandamara, what is \n",
      "your sister's name?\"\n",
      "\"Manimekala.\"\n",
      "\"Oh! What a delightful name! If her character and beauty \n",
      "are like the name...\"\n",
      "Kandamaran intervened and said in a forlorn voice, \"My \n",
      "friend! I beg this one thing of you. Please forget my sister. \n",
      "Please forget all that I mentioned about her to you. Do not \n",
      "even utter her name.\"\n",

      "\"It is true that I said it. Since then the situation has \n",
      "changed. My parents have arranged to wed my young \n",

      "Vandiya Devan cheered within his heart: \"Long live \n",
      "Manimekala.\" He did not have any trouble guessing who \n",
      "was selected to wed Manimekala. They must have pledged \n",
      "her to Madurandaka who stepped out of the closed \n",
      "palanquin. They are perhaps arranging such marriage \n",
      "alliances in order to gain strength for the Prince's cause. \n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor is a dangerous and capable politician.\n",
      "\"Oh! You have contracted one of your rich guest s who \n",

      "surprise about this; nor am I really disappointed. In a way \n",
      "it was expected.\"\n",
      "\"Expected? How is that?\"\n",
      "\"Who would give their daughter to a destitute -orphan like \n",
      "me? Which maid will agree to ma rry a poor fellow who \n",

      "ancestors had ruled kingdoms long ago?\"\n",
      "\"My dear friend! Enough of this, stop!  Don't think so \n",
      "shoddily of me or my family. What you think, is not the \n",
      "reason. There is something m uch more important. You will \n",
      "agree if you know of it. But I cannot reveal the reason \n",
      "now. When the time comes you will know.\"\n",
      "\"Kandamara, what is this? You have been talking quite \n",
      "mysteriously today.\"\"Forgive me for that. It is a big secret that I canno t reveal \n",

      "\"Thanks for the pledge! But what is the situation wherei n \n",

      "spear.\"\n",
      "\"There may be an opportunity to use that sword and that \n",

      "\"To Lanka? You will be surprised if you hear the details of \n",
      "the ridiculous campaign in Lanka. I believe we have to \n",
      "supply the rice and other foodstuffs from Chozla country \n",
      "for the soldiers fighting in Lanka. Shameful! I am talking \n",
      "about something else. Be patient for a while. I will tell you \n",

      "\"Alright. If you don't wish, don't tell me anything. Don't \n",

      "The fresh floods of the spring month filled that great river. \n",
      "The far side seemed very distant. Trees on the other shore \n",
      "seemed like small bushes. Reddish silt laden waters, filled \n",
      "with rapids and whirlpools drawing fantastic pictures, \n",
      "thundering joyously, celebrating with a loud  roaring sound, \n",
      "trying to break through the high banks on both sides, \n",

      "onwards  -- Vandiya Devan looked upon this sight and \n",
      "stood there in amazement.\n",
      "A ferry boat waited near the landing wharf. Two boat men \n",
      "with long poles in their hands waited readily. One \n",
      "gentleman was already seated in the boat. He appeared to \n",
      "be of the Saiva sect. Catching sight of the two men coming \n",
      "upon the bank, a boatman asked, \"Sirs! Are you both \n",
      "coming in this boat?\"\n",
      "\"Yes. He will come. Wait for a while.\"\n",
      "Both friends jumped off their horses. \"I came without \n",
      "thinking. What can I do with this horse of mine? Can it go \n",
      "in the boat?\" asked Vandiya Devan. \n",
      "\"No need. There! Look! Two of my footmen are following \n",
      "us. One of them will lead your horse back to Kadamboor. \n",
      "The other fellow will come with you in this boat. He will 4procure another horse for you on the other shore,\" said \n",
      "Kandamaran.\n",
      "\"Aha! How thoughtful. You are my true friend.\"\n",
      "\"You must have thought of the Kollidam as comp arable to \n",
      "the Palar and Pennar rivers. You wouldn't have known that \n",
      "you cannot cross this river with a horse.\"\n",
      "\"Yes. Forgive me for under -estimating the rivers of your \n",
      "Chozla lands. Gosh! What a river! What floods? It seems \n",
      "to roar like the ocean.\"\n",
      "The two friends took leave of each other with a hearty \n",
      "embrace. Vandiya Devan walked down the river bank and \n",
      "got into the boat. One of Kandamaran's footmen also \n",
      "climbed into the boat. The boat was ready to leave. The \n",
      "boatmen thrust their long poles deep into th e water.\n",
      "Suddenly, from a distance they could hear shouts: \"Stop! \n",
      "Stop the boat!\" said a voice. The boatmen hesitated \n",
      "without pushing their poles. The fellow who shouted came \n",
      "running up the bank. With one glance, Vandiya Devan \n",
      "recognized him. He was Azlva r-adiyan Nambi. \n",
      "Recognizing the newcomer as a follower of the Vaishnava \n",
      "sect, the gentleman in the boat said \"Go! Let the boat go! I \n",
      "will not come in the same boat as that imposter. Let him \n",
      "come in the next ferry.\"\n",
      "But Vandiya Devan looked at the boatmen and said, \"Wait \n",
      "a bit. Let him also come. There is plenty of room in this \n",

      "rocky mountain and canyon. As she came closer and \n",
      "closer, the joyous anticipation of meeting her beloved \n",
      "Lord, the Ocean King, made her thrive and grow. She went \n",
      "even further. Two arms grew to embrace the lover. \n",
      "Spreading her arms wide, she leaped and surged forward. \n",
      "Two arms were not sufficient for her ardent enthusiasm. \n",
      "Her loving arms grew into ten, twenty, hundred! Stretching \n",
      "out all these arms in eagerness she neared the Ocean King. \n",
      "She was the bride meeting her beloved. Chozla women, \n",
      "her bridesmaids, dressed her in such wondrous ways. They \n",
      "clothed her in the beautiful  greens of rice-fields. They \n",
      "decorated her with colorful flowers; and showered her with \n",
      "fragrant woods. How can we describe the enchanting \n",
      "kadamba and punnai trees on both her banks: they covered \n",
      "her with pearls and rubies of flowers. Who would not be overjoyed to cast their eyes upon you, \n",
      "dear Ponni?  Which maid will not be beguiled by this, your \n",

      "view this petite river from a little distance. The grov es of \n",
      "trees, growing thickly on both its banks hide the river. One \n",

      "Let our readers forget th at it is the inner courtyard of a \n",

      "full moon among twinkling stars, like a queen born to rule \n",
      "all seven worlds? Who is the ge ntle damsel seated next to \n",

      "these heavenly beauties coming down the stream, mixing \n",
      "the pleasant melody of their music with the gurgling noises \n",
      "of the river? \n",
      "One of them had large eyes shaped like dart ing fish; the \n",
      "other was blue eyed; yet another had a face like the \n",
      "blossoming lotus; another girl had wide dark eyes shaped \n",
      "like the petal of a blue lily. Ah! The girl playing the \n",
      "musical instrument, one could watch forever, her soft \n",
      "fingers dancing over the taunt strings  of the veena.\n",
      "What can we say about the sweetness of the song they \n",
      "sang? Even the water in the river seemed to be still as it \n",
      "listened to their melodious music. Even the cuckoos and \n",
      "parrots on the trees listened quietly. We humans, bless ed \n",
      "with the fortune of being able to listen, why should we not \n",
      "be enchanted by their song? Let us listen to them:\n",
      "Walk slowly, walk shyly,Praise to you, dear Cauvery;\n",

      "delightful when these maids sing it. Perhaps they are the \n",

      "of some sorcerer? It entices every beholder.\n",
      "The barge floated down gently till it stopped near a landing \n",

      "that dignified lady, comparable to a queen of the seven \n",
      "worlds; the other is her companion who was creating the \n",
      "enchanting harmony while playing the veena.  Though \n",
      "both are beautiful, there was a difference between the two \n",
      "of them. One has the dignity of a lotus blossom in full \n",
      "bloom. The other has the pleasantness of the night -time \n",
      "water lily. One is the radiant full moon; th e other is the \n",

      "daughter of Emperor Sundara Chozla. She is the elder \n",
      "sister to Arulmozli Varma who would later attain historic \n",
      "fame as Rajaraja I. She is the lady revered by the people as \n",
      "the young royal princess, the Younger Pirati. A \n",
      "distinguished daughter of the Tamils, she laid the \n",
      "foundations for the greatness of the Chozla Empire. She is \n",

      "monarchs in South Indian history.\n",
      "Her friend is Vanathi, a noblewoman from the clan of \n",
      "Kodumbalur chieftains. She came to enjoy the fortune of \n",
      "being a part of Kundavai's household. In the future she \n",
      "would attain greatness unparalleled in history. She is now \n",
      "a young girl, full of modesty and a pleasant gentleness.\n",
      "After both had alighted from the barge, Kundavai turned to \n",
      "her other companions and  said, \"You can all wait here. We \n",
      "will be back in an hour.\"\n",
      "All those maids, who were her companions, were \n",
      "noblewomen from the households of the aristocrats and \n",
      "chieftains in the Chozla nation. They had come to the \n",
      "Pazlayarai Palace, considering it a fort une to be included \n",

      "ashore with just one girl from among them, saying, \"I'll \n",

      "Why, even princes from across the seas from Yavana and \n",
      "Kadaram will come. I wonder which of these princes will \n",

      "determine that!\"\n",
      "\"Vanathi, even if I accept all that you say as truth, there is \n",

      "Vanathi now replied in a voice filled will cheer and \n",

      "It dries up in the bright sunlight and disappears without a \n",
      "trace!\"\n",
      "\"That is wrong, Vanathi. The sun recognizes the love of \n",

      "\"If there is a sadness in my heart, what is the use of asking \n",

      "The house of the Kudanthai Astrologer was situated in the \n",
      "outskirts of that city, in an isolated spot, besides a Kali \n",

      "and reached that house. From the way the charioteer drove \n",
      "his chariot without any hesitation or doubt, it appeared that \n",
      "he had driven there several times before. \n",
      "The Astrologer and one of his disciples waited readily \n",
      "outside the house. The Astrologer welcomed his visitors \n",
      "with great reverence and courtesy.\n",
      "\"Great lady! A reincarnation of both Kalaimagal (Goddess \n",
      "of Learning) and Thirumaga l (Goddess of Wealth)! \n",

      "\"Mr. Astrologer! I hope that nobody else will come in \n",
      "search of you at this time?\" asked Kundavai.\n",
      "\"No one will come Thaye!  Not  many people come in \n",
      "search of me these days. Only when troubles in the world \n",
      "increase will people seek the astrologer. Nowadays, under \n",
      "the rule of your esteemed father -- The Emperor Sundara \n",

      "\"Do you mean to say that I have some troubles and \n",
      "therefore, I have come to consult you?\" asked Kundavai.\n",
      "\"No. Great lady, no. Which blind fool will say that the \n",
      "beloved daughter of Sundara Chozla who possesses \n",
      "immense wealth, has any troubles? Since the people have \n",
      "no troubles, this poor astrologer is cast into misfortune. \n",
      "Nobody takes care of him. Therefore you have come here \n",
      "like a Goddess with solicitude for my trou bles. Please \n",
      "enter and grace my humble house. Look at me, talking \n",
      "while I detain you here on the doorstep!\" said the \n",
      "resourceful Astrologer.\n",
      "Kundavai turned to the charioteer and said, \"Take the \n",

      "and wait.\"\n",
      "Kundavai and Vanathi entered the Astrologer's house as he \n",

      "The parlor in the Astrologer's house was decorated to \n",

      "lit. The floor gleamed with intricate kolam decorations. \n",
      "Several tablets and palm leaf charts with the scribbles and \n",

      "\"Madam, please tell me why you have come?\"\n",
      "\"Sir! Can you not find out even that by your astrology?\" \n",
      "asked Kundavai.\n",
      "\"So be it, Thaye!\" said the Astrologer and closed his eyes. \n",
      "He muttered some incantations and after a while looked at \n",
      "them saying \"Lady, you have come here today, mainly to \n",

      "grace of the Goddess reveals to me.\"\n",
      "\"Aha! Remarkable! How can we praise your powers? Yes \n",
      "sir! I have come to ask about this girl. She came to the \n",
      "Pazlayarai Palace about a year ago. For the first eight \n",
      "months she was very cheerful and happy. Amongst my \n",
      "companions she was the most joyous, most filled with \n",
      "playful laughter. For the last four months, something has \n",
      "happened to her. Often, she seems depressed. She seems to \n",
      "live in some abstract world. She has for gotten her laughter. \n",
      "She says that nothing is wrong with her health. If her \n",
      "parents come and ask me tomorrow, what reply can I \n",
      "give?\"\n",
      "\"Thaye! Is she not the beloved daughter of the Lord of \n",
      "Kodumbalur? Is her name Vanathi Devi?\" asked the \n",
      "Atrologer.\n",
      "\"Yes; you seem to know everything.\"\n",
      "\"I even have the horoscope of this young Lady.  I have it in \n",
      "my collection. Please wait a little.\"  \n",
      "The Astrologer opened an old casket by his side and \n",
      "searched awhile. He then picked up a palm leaf notation of \n",
      "a horoscope and peered at it.\n",

      "Besides the virtue of being a pilgrimage center, it was also \n",
      "famous because of the Astro loger of Kudanthai. A little \n",
      "distance to the south of Kudanthai, a majestic view of the \n",

      "The Astrologer of Kudanthai had collecte d the horoscopes \n",
      "of all the royal family living at the Pazlayarai Palace. He \n",
      "had searched amidst this collection and found the \n",

      "at the palm leaf notation of the horoscope for a while, he \n",
      "stared at the face of Vanathi; then again looked at the \n",
      "notation. He was peering and staring one after the other, \n",
      "but did not open his mouth to utter a single word!\n",
      "With a little impatience Kundavai asked, \"What Sir? Are \n",
      "you going to say something or not?\"\n",
      "\"Thaye! What can I say? How can I say it? I had studied \n",
      "this horoscope once before and could not believe it myself. \n",
      "I doubted if anything could be like it and kept it aside. \n",
      "Now, when I behold the divine face of this Lady and see \n",

      "\"Be amazed! Be astounded! After you have been \n",
      "astounded enough, say something in particular.\"\n",
      "\"Madam, this is a very fortunate horoscope. I am saying it \n",
      "with the belief that you will not mistake my words. This is \n",
      "one step better than even you r horoscope! I have never, till \n",
      "now, seen such a lucky horoscope.\"\n",
      "Kundavai smiled. Vanathi said with some shyness, \"Akka! \n",
      "He is calling this most unfortunate girl the luckiest person \n",
      "in this world! Everything he utters will be like this.\"\n",
      "\"Amma, what are you saying? If my statements are \n",
      "incorrect, I will give up my practice!\" said the Astrologer.\n",
      "\"No. Mr. Astrologer, no. Don't do anything like that. Keep \n",
      "predicting such good things to the people. But you are \n",
      "uttering generalities; you have said nothing in particular. \n",
      "That is why she doubts you.\"\n",
      "\"You want me to say something specific? Here, I will say \n",
      "it. Four months ago, something that appeared to be an ill \n",
      "omen occurred. Something slipped and fell. But in truth, \n",
      "that is not an ill omen. It is from tha t incident that this \n",
      "Lady will obtain all her good fortune.\"\n",
      "\"Vanathi, remember what I said? See?\" said Kundavai \n",
      "Devi.\n",
      "\"You must have told him about it before!\" said Vanathi.\n",
      "\"Sir, look at the way this girl talks?\"\n",
      "\"Let her talk Thaye, let her say what ever she wants now. \n",
      "Tomorrow when she marries the king of kings ....\"\n",
      "\"Yes, talk about such things! Young girls will listen \n",
      "happily if you speak to them about marriage.\"8\"That is what I have been saying too. If I suddenly raise \n",
      "the topic of marriage, peo ple will say `This old man has \n",
      "lost his senses.' That is why ...\"\n",
      "\"Where will her husband come from? When will he come? \n",
      "What is his identification? Can you tell us all these things \n",
      "from the horoscope, Sir?\"\n",
      "\"Oh yes! Why not? I can say it very well.\"  The  Astrologer \n",
      "peered into the horoscope once more. Whether he \n",
      "examined it carefully or pretended to do examine it, none \n",
      "can say!\n",
      "Then looking up decisively he said, \"Madam! A husband \n",
      "for this maid does not have to come from very far! He is \n",
      "quite nearby. However, that brave warrior is not in this \n",
      "country now. He has gone across the seas.\"\n",
      "Upon hearing these words, Kundavai looked at Vanathi. \n",
      "Vanathi tried to contain the happiness that bubbled in her \n",
      "heart; but could not do so: her face showed it.\n",
      "\"Then, who is he? What clan? Any signs to recognize \n",
      "him?\"\n",
      "\"Oh yes. Very clear signs. A prince fortunate enough to \n",
      "marry this girl, will have the sign of the conch and discus \n",
      "on his palms.\" \n",
      "Once again Kundavai looked at Vanathi. But Vanathi was \n",
      "looking down, almost hiding her face. \"Won't there be \n",
      "some signs or significant lines on her palms also?\" asked \n",
      "Kundavai Pirati. \n",
      "\"Thaye! Have you ever seen the soles of this girl's feet? ...\"\n",
      "\"Sir! What are you saying? Are you asking me to touch her \n",
      "feet?\"\n",
      "(Greeting a person by touching their feet denotes extreme \n",
      "humility, or servitude.)\n",
      "\"No! Oh no! I am not saying anything like that! However, \n",
      "sometime in the future, thousands of princesses, queens \n",
      "and empresses will pray for the fortune of touching this \n",
      "noble lady's feet.\"\n",
      "\"Akka! This old man is teasing me. Is it for this, that you \n",
      "brought me here? Please get up; let us go\"  Vanathi said \n",
      "this with some real anger.\n",
      "\"Why are you agitated my dear? Let him keep saying what \n",
      "he wants ...\"\n",
      "\"I am not saying anything. I am ju st explaining the \n",
      "notations in this horoscope. Poets often talk about lotus \n",
      "feet. Please ask this Lady to show me her feet a little bit. \n",
      "Her sole will surely have the line of the red -lotus.\"\"Well! That's enough Sir. If you say anything more about \n",
      "this girl, she will get hold of my hands and drag me out. \n",
      "Tell us something about the man who is to be her \n",
      "husband.\"\n",
      "\"Yes. Of course, I shall do so. The fortunate youth who \n",
      "will take her hand will be the bravest among brave; he will \n",
      "wear the victory garlands fro m fighting in the forefront of \n",
      "hundreds of campaigns. He will be a king of kings. With \n",
      "the praise and support of thousands of kings, he will sit \n",
      "upon the throne of an emperor for a long time.\"\n",
      "\"I do not believe your words. How is that possible?\" asked \n",
      "Kundavai. Several emotions -- eagerness, happiness, fear, \n",
      "doubt, worry -- danced on her face.\n",
      "\"I too don't believe it. He is thinking of something else and \n",
      "saying all this. He is uttering such words to make you \n",
      "happy!\" said Vanathi.\n",
      "\"If you don't believe my  words today, there is no harm. \n",
      "One day you will believe it. Don't forget this poor \n",
      "astrologer on that day.\"\n",
      "Vanathi asked once again: \"Akka, shall we go?\" Two tear \n",
      "drops peeped at the corners of her dark eyes.\n",
      "\"I have to tell you just one more thing. Pl ease hear that \n",
      "also and then leave. There will be several obstacles and \n",
      "dangers for the young man who is to marry this Princess. \n",
      "He will have several enemies ...\"\n",
      "\"Oh!\"\n",
      "\"But all the dangers and obstacles will fly away in the end. \n",
      "Enemies will be totally destroyed; the Lord who attains \n",
      "this Lady will cross all impediments and achieve great \n",
      "positions. There is something much more important than \n",
      "even this ... Thaye! I am an old man. Therefore, I can \n",
      "reveal all without hiding anything. You should look at the \n",
      "stomach of this girl sometime. If you do not find the lines \n",
      "and sign of a banyan (ficus) leaf on her stomach, I will \n",
      "give up my practice of astrology.\"\n",
      "\"Sir, what is so special about the sign of the banyan leaf?\"\n",
      "\"Don't you know who the Lord who reposed on the banyan \n",
      "leaf is? A son with the aspects of that great Vishnu will be \n",
      "born to her. Her Lord is likely to have all sorts of dangers, \n",
      "obstacles, impediments and bad periods. But the son who \n",
      "is to be born of this Lady will have nothing that is a \n",
      "deterrent. All that he thinks of will be concluded; anything \n",
      "he undertakes will be completed; his touch will be golden; \n",
      "wherever he steps will be under his sway; whatever he sees \n",
      "will have the tiger-flag flying over it. Madam, the armies \n",
      "led by her son will flow i n all directions, with no \n",
      "hinderance, like the fresh floods of the Ponni. The Goddess \n",
      "of Victory will be his bonded slave. The fame of his native \n",
      "lands will spread across the worlds. The fame of his clan \n",
      "will last as long as this world exists!\"9When the Astrologer spoke these words as if in some \n",
      "frenzy, Kundavai was looking at him with rapt attention, \n",
      "listening to every word he uttered. She was startled to turn \n",
      "around upon hearing the distressed call, \"Akka!\"  \n",
      "\"Something is happening to me,\" said Vanathi  in further \n",
      "distress. Suddenly she fainted and fell to the floor.\n",
      "\"Sir! Please fetch some water quickly,\" saying this, \n",
      "Kundavai lifted Vanathi onto her lap. The Astrologer \n",
      "brought some water. Kundavai sprinkled the water on her \n",
      "friends face.\n",
      "\"Nothing will go wrong, Amma! Do not be concerned,\" \n",
      "said the Astrologer.\n",
      "\"I am not worried. This is her habit. This has happened \n",
      "four or five times till now. She will open her eyes and get \n",
      "up after some time. Upon waking she will ask if this is the \n",
      "earth or paradise,\" said Kundavai.\n",
      "Then, in a much softer voice she asked \"Sir! I came to ask \n",
      "you something very important. Have you any news?\"\n",
      "The Astrologer's manner changed; he said some words to \n",
      "her very precisely and quickly.\n",
      "Then, Kundavai Pirati asked, \"I hear tha t people in the \n",
      "countryside and cities are talking about all sorts of things. \n",
      "The long tailed comet has been appearing in the skies for \n",
      "sometime. Is there some meaning to all this? Is there some \n",
      "danger to the empire? Will there be any change, \n",
      "confusion?\"\n",
      "\"Lady, don't ask me about that. There is no horoscope for \n",
      "kingdoms, nations or political events; neither can I predict \n",
      "anything by astrology about them. I know nothing about \n",
      "such matters through the science I practice. Perhaps the \n",
      "seers and philosophers or  the devout and ascetic may be \n",
      "able to foresee something. This poor fellow does not have \n",
      "such powers. In politics the stars and planets of astrology \n",
      "have no power.\"  The Astrologer spoke these words with  a \n",
      "certain emphasis, looking at Vanathi who seemed t o be \n",
      "stirring.\n",
      "\"Sir! You talk very skillfully. You don't have to study the \n",
      "horoscope of a nation. But can you not reveal particulars \n",
      "about my father and my brothers? Isn't studying their \n",
      "horoscopes like looking at the horoscope of the nation?\"\n",
      "\"I will look into them at leisure and tell you. Thaye, in \n",
      "general this period is full of confusion and danger. All of \n",
      "us have to be a little careful.\"\n",
      "\"Sir! About my father..., the Emperor ... I am quite worried \n",
      "ever since he moved to Tanjore from Pazlayarai.\"\n",
      "\"I have told you earlier, Madam. This is a period of grave \n",
      "danger for the Emperor. All your family has to face great danger. With the grace of the Goddess Durga all will be \n",
      "overcome.\"\n",
      "\"Akka, where are we?\" asked the faint voice of Vanathi.\n",
      "Vanathi, who had her head on Kundavai's lap, blinked her \n",
      "eyelids several times like the buzzing bee, and looked \n",
      "around.\n",
      "\"Darling, we are still on this earth. The flower -laden \n",
      "flying-chariot has not yet come to take us to the heavens. \n",
      "Get up! Let us get into our mere horse  drawn chariot and \n",
      "go back to the palace.\"\n",
      "Vanathi sat up and asked, \"Did I faint?\"\n",
      "\"No. You did not faint. You took a little nap on my lap. I \n",
      "even sang you a lullaby. Did you not hear it?\"\n",
      "\"Please do not scold me Akka. Without my awareness, I \n",
      "felt dizzy.\"\n",
      "\"Yes. You will feel dizzy. Quite dizzy. If this Astrologer \n",
      "had predicted all those grand fortunes for me, even my \n",
      "head would feel dizzy.\"\n",
      "\"Not because of that Akka. You think I believed \n",
      "everything he said?\"\n",
      "\"I don't know if you believed it or not? B ut this Astrologer \n",
      "was quite worried about you. I should not take a poor \n",
      "spirited person like you, anywhere, anymore.\"\n",
      "\"I said that I did not want to come to this astrologer. You \n",
      "insisted ...\"\n",
      "\"It is my fault. Get up. Let us go. Can you walk to the \n",
      "doorstep? Or, should I carry you on my hip?\n",
      "\"No. No. I can walk very well.\"\n",
      "\"Please have a little patience Thaye! I shall give you some \n",
      "sacrament-offerings of the Goddess. Please receive them \n",
      "before you go,\" said the Astrologer as he tidied his papers.\n",
      "\"Sir, you described all sorts of things for me. But you did \n",
      "not say anything for Akka?\" asked Vanathi.\n",
      "\"Amma, I have told everything to the Younger Pirati. \n",
      "What is there to say afresh?\"\n",
      "\"About the bravest of warriors who is to marry Akka ....\"\n",
      "\"That dauntless gallant ....\" interrupted Kundavai with \n",
      "some surprise.\n",
      "\"Doubtless. A very capable prince...\"\n",
      "\"He who has all the thirty -two signs of good looks; Jupiter \n",
      "in wisdom; a veritable Saraswati (deity of learning) in 0knowledge; handsome as Cupid, Oh no, as Arj una (epic \n",
      "warrior)!\"\n",
      "\"When will that handsome prince, deserving of the \n",
      "Younger Pirati come and where will he come from?\"\n",
      "\"How will he come? Upon a horse? On a chariot? By \n",
      "walk? Or, will he rip open the roof and jump down from \n",
      "the skies?\" asked Kundavai w ith a mocking voice.\n",
      "\"Akka, I can hear the hoof beats of a horse,\" Vanathi said \n",
      "this with some agitation.\n",
      "\"You will hear most wonderful things unheard by anyone \n",
      "else.\"\n",
      "\"No. I am not joking. Listen.\"\n",
      "By now all three could hear the quick gallop of a hor se on \n",
      "the road outside.\n",
      "\"What if you hear it? Won't horses gallop along the road?\" \n",
      "said Kundavai.\n",
      "\"No. It seems to be coming here, to this house.\"\n",
      "\"OK. Get up. Let us go.\"\n",
      "At this time they could hear some confused noises outside \n",
      "the door. Voices could  be heard.\n",
      "\"Is this the Astrologer's house?\"\n",
      "\"Yes; who are you?\"\n",
      "\"Is the Astrologer home?\"\n",
      "\"You cannot enter.\"\n",
      "\"I will do so.\"\n",
      "\"I cannot let you.\"\n",

      "\"Come later.\"\n",
      "\"I cannot come later; I am in a great hurry.\"\n",
      "\"Hey! You! You fellow! Stop! Stop!\"\n",
      "\"Damn it! Move away! I'll kill you if you stand in the \n",
      "way.\"\n",
      "\"Sir! Sir! Please! Please! Don't enter! Don't go in.\"\n",

      "In the ancient Tamil land, for almost six hundred years, \n",
      "(up till about the tenth century AD) t he religions of \n",
      "Buddhism and Jainism held prestigious sway. Because of \n",
      "these religions, the Tamil land gained several advantages. \n",
      "Sculpture, painting, poetry, literature and other such arts \n",
      "were nurtured and developed. Emphasis was on Sanskrit. 2Later the Azlvar's (Vaishnava saints) and Nayanmar's \n",
      "(Saiva saints) appeared. They sang melodious poems --\n",
      "devotional songs in nectar -sweet, divine Tamil. They \n",
      "fostered and developed the Vaishnava (of Vishnu) and \n",
      "Saiva (of Shiva) sects of Hinduism. Their preaching wa s \n",
      "quite powerful. They utilized the power of art, sculpture \n",
      "and music for their missionary work. Several others set \n",
      "their songs to divine music and sang them. Those who \n",
      "listened to these musical poems were enticed, enamored \n",
      "and subject to fanatic devotion.  The Shiva and Vishnu \n",
      "temple-towns mentioned in such devotional songs acquired \n",
      "new merit and fresh holiness. Temples, which till then \n",
      "were built with wood and brick, were renovated and rebuilt \n",
      "with stone and sculpture. Such holy renovation -works \n",
      "were undertaken even since Vijayala Chozla's times by the \n",
      "Chozla monarchs and members of their family as well as \n",
      "other nobility.\n",
      "At about the same time an important event occurred in the \n",
      "Kerala nation. A great soul was born in the village of \n",
      "Kaladi. At a very young  age he gave up worldly pleasures \n",
      "and became an ascetic. He studied all the sciences and \n",
      "literature in the northern language (Sanskrit) and became \n",
      "an expert. He then established the foundation for the \n",
      "Advaita philosophy, based on the principles gained from\n",
      "the Hindu scriptures -- Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavat Gita \n",
      "and Brahma Sutras because of his expertise in Sanskrit. \n",
      "He, Sankara the Teacher, traveled all over the Indian sub -\n",
      "continent and established eight religious -seats for \n",
      "propagating Advaita philosophy. Ascetics who espoused \n",
      "his philosophy spread his word all over the country. \n",
      "(Advaita meaning non-dual, advocates the non -dual nature \n",
      "of existence; that God is only one; and that God and man \n",
      "are one and the same.)\n",
      "Thus, in the Tamil lands, during the times of our story \n",
      "(tenth century AD) there was a great religious revival and \n",
      "awakening. Certain harmful consequences, arising out of \n",
      "this revival, also spread throughout the countryside. \n",
      "Fanatic Shiva devotees and fanatic Vishnu devotees rose \n",
      "here and there. They entered into fights wherever they met \n",
      "each other. Sometimes, Advaita philosophers also entered \n",
      "into these disputes. Wordy duels often turned into fistfights \n",
      "and brawls.\n",
      "There is an interesting story that reveals the extent of this \n",
      "rivalry between the religious sects of those times. A man \n",
      "from Srirangam, of the Vaishnava sect, was once walking \n",
      "along the outer walls of the Shiva temple at Thiru -anai-\n",
      "kava. Suddenly a stone hit his head. He was wounded and \n",
      "bleeding. The Vaishnava man looked up towards the s ky. \n",
      "He saw a crow sitting atop the old temple tower and \n",
      "surmised that a piece of brick from the dilapidated spire \n",
      "dislodged by the crow must have fallen on his head. \n",
      "Immediately he forgot his wound and pain and became \n",
      "quite delighted. He said, \"Oh you devo ut Vaishnava crow \n",
      "from Srirangam! Good that you are demolishing this Shiva \n",
      "temple completely!\"In those days, this fanatic rivalry between the Vaishnavas \n",
      "and Saivas was widespread. Knowing about this will be \n",
      "very helpful to readers who may have the intent ion of \n",
      "reading further chapters in this story.\n",
      "When the boat reached the other shore, the Saiva \n",
      "gentleman looked at Azlvar -adiyan and cursed him with \n",
      "these words: \"May you loose all prosperity and become \n",
      "utterly destitute,\" before he went on his way. \n",
      "The footman from Kadamboor who had come with \n",

      "wide-spreading, large tree raised a pleasing musical sound. \n",
      "Both of them, Devan and Nambi, tried to pry the secrets \n",

      "were ardent Vaishnava devotees.  One day, his father was \n",
      "walking in the gardens along the river bank when he found \n",
      "an orphan baby girl who was abandoned in the garden. He \n",
      "brought the infant home. Because the child was very \n",
      "attractive and beautiful, all the members of his family \n",
      "loved and nourished her. Since the child was found in a \n",
      "garden (nandavan), they named her Nandini. Nambi, \n",
      "considering her a younger sister, loved and cherished her. \n",
      "As Nandini grew in years, her devotion to God Vishnu also \n",
      "grew. All the people around them believed that she would \n",
      "become another Andal (Vaishnava saint) to captivate all \n",
      "their hearts. Azlvar-adiyan believed it more than anyone \n",
      "else. After his father's death, he took up the  responsibility \n",
      "of raising that girl. The two of them travelled from one \n",
      "town to another, singing Vaishnava poems and spreading \n",
      "the belief in devotion to Vishnu. People who heard \n",

      "wide, could be seen at the foot of a thick tree trunk, \n",
      "blending with the roots, half in the water and half on the \n",
      "bank. He had recently seen one such fearful crocodile in \n",
      "the floods of the Kollidam. He had heard how dangerous \n",
      "the beast was. Therefore, when he saw the reptile, his heart \n",
      "skipped a beat and his wh ole body froze with agitation for \n",
      "a minute. The crocodile was very near the girls who had been \n",
      "laughing merrily a few moments earlier. It was opening its \n",
      "horrible jaws wide and appeared monstrous. The crocodile \n",
      "had to only move just one step closer; one of the girls \n",

      "tree!\n",
      "However confused his heart and mind, there was nothing \n",
      "wrong with his courage. He did not even think beyond one \n",

      "swiftly threw the spear in his hand. The spear pierced the \n",
      "crocodile's back, entered deep into its hide and stood \n",
      "upright. Our hero, immediately jumped off his horse and \n",
      "drawing his sword he rushed towards the reptile to  finish \n",
      "it off in one stroke. \n",

      "He moved closer to the crocodile and then hesitated as he \n",

      "By now, that girl -- the lady who had dwelt in his thoughts \n",

      "requested by him did not come fr om his native land. \n",
      "Therefore, once in the midst of all his endeavors he came \n",

      "Prince to come back here for a minute.\" The brother who \n",
      "had never crossed the commands of his sister, came back \n",
      "accordingly. The sight of his sister trying to reviv e the \n",
      "young girl lying on her lap touched his heart.\n",
      "\"Akka! Who is this girl? What is her name?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"She is the daughter of the Younger Lord Velir of \n",
      "Kodumbalur. Her name is Vanathi; of a timid disposition.\"\n",
      "\"Oh! Now I understand why she fainted.  Was it not her \n",

      "die in the battlefront over there? Perhaps she remembered \n",
      "that.\"\n",
      "\"Maybe. But don't worry about her. I can look after her. I \n",

      "By now, Vanathi was regaining consciousness; perhaps \n",
      "due to the pleasant sound of Prince Arulmozli's voice! Her \n",
      "eyelids opened softly. Upon glimpsing the Prince, her eyes \n",
      "opened wider. Her face gained some color and revived; \n",
      "coral red lips smiled; cheeks dimpled.\n",
      "Along with her senses a shyness also returned. She sat up \n",
      "quickly. She was mortified upon seeing the Princes s \n",
      "behind her. She recalled everything that happened. \"Oh! \n",
      "What have I done Akka?\" she asked with remorse.\n",
      "Before Kundavai could reply, the Prince intervened, \"Don't \n",

      "From that day onwards Kundavai showered a special \n",
      "affection upon Vanathi. She kept her by her side \n",
      "constantly. She had her personal tutors teach her all the \n",
      "arts and learning she had. She took Vanathi along \n",
      "wherever she went. She led her into the garden and talked \n",
      "secrets. She shared all her dreams about her younger brother with her new friend. Vanathi listened to everything \n",

      "marry the bravest of brave warriors, who was to give birth \n",
      "to a son to rule the whole world, be so fainthearted? \n",
      "Kundavai wanted to change her timidity and make her \n",

      "disembarked. When everyone had climbed down, one of \n",
      "the girls screamed \"Crocodile!\" \"Help!\" She was pointing \n",
      "beyond the tree near which they were standing. All the \n",
      "other girls soon took up the cry and ran hither and thither.\n",
      "But Vanathi, who was usually of a frightened disposition, \n",
      "did not exhibit any fear. She was not scared even upon \n",
      "seeing the horrible crocodile, with its wide  open jaws, right \n",
      "next to her. Vanathi was not afraid even when she saw the \n",

      "rushing forward. When Vallavarayan heard the words  of \n",
      "the lady who stood in front of the crocodile, his whole \n",
      "body became alert.  His disappointment that she had not \n",

      "demolished.  \n",
      "But, that crocodile behind her - with its gaping jaws --\n",
      "somehow created an uneasiness in him. Why is she \n",

      "not to bother? And why is that horrible crocodile not \n",
      "moving from its spot all this time?\n",
      "The lady continued: \"Sir! In Kudanthai, you begged \n",

      "We came away without giving you any reply. You might \n",
      "have perhaps construed that all women of the Chozla \n",

      "even the sweet music of  the flute and lute fill me with such \n",

      "speed and accuracy...\"\n",
      "All the other girls standing under that tree now laughed \n",
      "sharply. The laughter shattered Vandiya Devan's infatuated \n",
      "dream. The magic cords, -- that girl's speech -- which \n",
      "bound him, were cut loose. He examined the crocodile \n",
      "again; moved aside from the girl in front of him and neared \n",
      "the reptile.  He shook the spear embedded on its back and \n",
      "pulled it loose. No blood gushed from the hole made by his \n",
      "weapon: then? some plant ain fiber and cotton came out.\n",

      "How will I wipe out this blemish? ...\n",
      "All these thoughts raced through Vandiya Devan's mind \n",
      "within one moment. If those who stood there laughingly \n",
      "had been men, the clearing would have turned into a \n",
      "battlefield! Those who dared to laugh would have lost their \n",

      "neighed. Vandiya Devan felt that even his horse was \n",

      "towards the horse. He jumped upon its back and smacked \n",

      "deeps currents.\n",

      "What is represented by the sign of the fish? Ah! isn't the \n",
      "fish a symbol on the Pandiya flag? Perhaps, ha! ... Could it \n",
      "be so? Let us wait ... Let me wait with some patience. The \n",
      "patient ones shall inherit the fields; the hasty will get the \n",
      "forest!  But these days it seems better to inherit the forest \n",
      "than the field. Anyway let me be patient...  Azlvar -adiyan \n",
      "shared these thoughts with the invisible vampire in the \n",
      "tree.\n",
      "Soon, his expectations came true. The ferry -boat left \n",
      "without Idumban Kari. Idumban looked up at the ficus tree \n",

      "After making sure that Azlvar -adiyan was nowhere in sight \n",
      "he came back to the same spot under the t ree. His eyes \n",
      "searched around once again before he sat down. His eyes \n",
      "kept looking hither and thither as if searching for someone \n",
      "or something. But, he did not look up into the branches of \n",
      "the tree. Even if he had looked up he would not have \n",
      "spotted Azlvar-adiyan easily for Thirumalai had hidden \n",
      "himself well.\n",
      "About an hour passed in this fashion. Azlvar -adiyan's legs \n",
      "began turning numb. He could not remain hidden amidst \n",
      "the tree branches much longer. Idumban Kari did not \n",
      "appear as if he was about to leave soon. How to escape? \n",
      "However carefully he descended on the other side of the \n",
      "tree, he was sure to make some noise. Idumban Kari would \n",
      "surely see him. He had a sharp knife thrust in his \n",
      "waistband. What guarantee that he would not use it?\n",
      "What can I do? Shall I make horrible noises like a ghost or \n",
      "demon and jump down on him? If I jump like that he may \n",
      "think that the vampire is attacking him and fall down in a \n",
      "faint or run away. I can then run away and escape! ... \n",
      "When Thirumalai Nambi Azlvar -adiyan was considering \n",
      "these options, it seemed as if his patience would be \n",
      "rewarded.\n",
      "A man could be seen walking up from the south west i.e., \n",
      "the Kudanthai road. Thirumalai's intuition warned that \n",
      "Idumban Kari was waiting for that man. Soon, his intuition \n",
      "proved to be right.\n",
      "Upon seeing the new man, Idumban Kari stood up. The \n",
      "newcomer made a sign like the one Idumban had made \n",
      "before. That is, he placed the palm of one hand upon the \n",
      "other and wriggled his thumbs, making the sign of the fish. \n",
      "On seeing it, Idumban made a similar sign with his hands.\n",

      "sure that I am following you as you go on.\"\n",
      "\"Fine. It is not a good road. The path is full of stones and \n",

      "It was a practice among the Tamils of the ancient times to \n",
      "erect a hero stone and raise a memorial for great warriors \n",
      "who died bravely in the battlefield. If the memorial was \n",
      "marked merely by a stone tablet the place was known as \n",

      "Those who read world history may recall that the great \n",
      "battles of Waterloo and Panipat changed the very co urse of \n",
      "history. The battle of Thiru -puram-biyam had a similar \n",
      "significance with regard to South Indian history. That \n",
      "battle took place in the year AD 885, about a hundred \n",
      "years before the times of our story. It is essential that all \n",
      "persons interested in the history of the Tamils should know \n",
      "the details of that battle.\n",
      "The early Chozla kings of the Sangam Age -- Karikala \n",
      "Valava, Ilan-chet-chenni, Perunar-killi, Thodi-thot \n",
      "Sembiyan -- ruled with great fame and prosperity. For \n",
      "about five to six hundred year s after their times, a long \n",
      "eclipse clouded the fame of the Chozla's. The Pandiyas in \n",
      "the south and the Pallavas of the north squashed the \n",
      "Chozlas into becoming petty chieftains. Towards the end, \n",
      "the Chozlas had to give up their coveted capital city, \n",
      "Uraiyoor, to the Pandiyas and move east. The Chozla \n",
      "chieftains who moved east made Pazlayarai, near \n",
      "Kudanthai, their new capital. But they did not forget their \n",
      "rights to their long time capital, i.e., Uraiyoor.  Neither did \n",
      "they give up their title of Rooster K ings -- a title of \n",
      "monarchs who ruled from Uraiyoor which was also known \n",
      "as Kozliyoor (kozli in Tamil means rooster.)\n",
      "Of the Chozlas of Pazlayarai, Vijayala became famous as \n",
      "an incomparable, brave warrior. He had fought in the forefront of various battles  and had ninety-six war-wounds \n",
      "on his body. Latter day poets sang his praises enumerating \n",
      "his wounds to be `Ninety and twice of three more' and said \n",
      "that he `Wore on his brave body ornaments of battle -\n",
      "wounds numbering ninety and six.' His son, Aditya Chozl a \n",
      "was comparable to his father in bravery. He also took part \n",
      "in several great campaigns. Vijayala Chozla had retired in \n",
      "his old age after crowning his son as the king. \n",
      "At that time the enmity between the Pandiyas and Pallavas \n",
      "had grown to result in sever al skirmishes and fights. The \n",
      "Pandiya king of that time was Varaguna. The Pallava \n",
      "monarch was Aparajita. The battles between these two \n",
      "powerful rulers often took place on Chozla territory! Just \n",
      "like the rooster caught in the midst of a clash between one \n",
      "elephant and another, the Chozla people suffered: caught \n",
      "in the midst of the enmity of two super -powers. \n",
      "King Vijayala tried to make the best use of these wars for \n",
      "gaining his own supremacy. In each skirmish or battle he \n",
      "would join forces with one opponent  or the other. Victory \n",
      "and defeat were equal: but the warrior spirit of Chozla men \n",
      "became well established.\n",
      "Several tributaries branch from the Cauvery to form a delta \n",
      "-- the fertile lands  of the Chozla country. All these \n",

      "There is only one tributary between the Kollidam and \n",
      "Cauvery rivers. It is known as the River Manni. \n",
      "The final test of strength between the super -powers took \n",
      "place as a great battle near the village of Thiru -puram-\n",
      "biyam situated to the north of the Manni. The armed \n",
      "strength of both sides was more or less equal. Pallava \n",
      "Aparajita was supported by the Ganga King Prithvi -pathi. \n",
      "Aditya Chozla also supported Aparajita.\n",
      "Compared to the armies of the Pandiyas, Pallavas and \n",
      "Gangas the Chozla battalion was tiny. But Aditya knew \n",
      "that if the Pandiyas were victorious this time, the Chozlas \n",
      "would be totally destroyed. Therefore, like the Cauvery \n",
      "mixing into the mighty ocean, his tiny army joined the \n",
      "larger Pallava forces.\n",
      "The battlefield spread across one square league. The four \n",
      "divisions of the army -- chariot legions, elephant brigade, \n",
      "cavalry and infantry were ready. When elephant clashed \n",
      "with elephant, like two mountains hurled against each \n",
      "other, the skies thundered. Horses flew against h orses like \n",
      "furious storms thrown one against the other; lances and \n",
      "long spears held by the horsemen shone like lightning. \n",
      "Chariot dashed against chariot: broken into smithereens \n",
      "and thrown in all directions. The noise of the whistling \n",
      "arrows and clashing swords filled the skies and shook the \n",
      "four corners of the world. After a fierce conflict lasting \n",
      "over three days, the field looked like a sea of blood. Dead \n",
      "horses and elephants appeared like islands in that sea. \n",
      "Lifeless bodies formed dunes. Broken chariot s floated like \n",
      "driftwood from a sunken ship. Both sides had lost \n",
      "thousands, tens of thousands of men.8After the first three days of battle, a very tiny battalion of \n",
      "the Pallavas remained intact. Those men who lived were \n",
      "very tired. But Pandiya forces atta cked again and again as \n",
      "if they owned some divine spell against tiredness. A \n",
      "council-of-war was held in King Aparajita's tent. The three \n",
      "kings -- Aparajita, Prithvi-pathi and Aditya together with \n",
      "their generals, met to discuss further action. They decided \n",
      "that they could no longer oppose the enemy; it was best to \n",
      "retreat to the north of the Kollidam.\n",
      "At that point a miracle happened in the battlefield. \n",
      "Vijayala Chozla -- weak with old age, bearing numberless \n",
      "war-scars over his body, having lost the power t o use his \n",
      "legs because of wounds -- somehow came to the battle \n",
      "front. The old war-lion realized that if the Pallava forces \n",
      "withdrew beyond the Kollidam, the Chozla entity would be \n",
      "completely wiped out. His roar instilled new life in the \n",
      "remaining Pallava men.\n",
      "\"One elephant; give me just one elephant,\" shouted the old \n",
      "monarch.\n",
      "\"All our elephant brigade is lost. Not one elephant remains \n",
      "alive,\" they said.\n",
      "\"One horse. At least bring me one good horse,\" he asked.\n",
      "\"Not a single horse survived,\" replied the m en.\n",
      "\"At least, have two brave warriors of the Chozla nation \n",
      "survived? If you are alive come forward!\" roared the brave \n",
      "soldier.\n",
      "Instead of two, two-hundred came forward. \n",
      "\"Two men -- with courage in their heart and strength in \n",
      "their shoulders -- two among you lift me up. The others \n",
      "follow two after two to take their place. If the two carrying \n",
      "me fall, those behind come forward.\" The bravest of brave \n",
      "men spoke with a firmness.\n",
      "Two giants came forward and lifted Vijayala onto their \n",
      "shoulders. \"GO! Go to t he war-front!\" he roared.\n",
      "A battle was still being fought in one corner of the field. \n",
      "The southern forces were fighting bravely, making the \n",
      "northerners retreat. Vijayala Chozla seated on the \n",
      "shoulders of two brave men entered that fight. He rushed \n",
      "into the midst of the enemy legion, swirling two large \n",
      "swords held in each hand; none could oppose him or stop \n",
      "him. Wherever he went dead bodies of enemy men rose in \n",
      "piles on both sides. Men who retreated earlier came back \n",
      "to see this miracle. They stood in shock  to see the inhuman \n",
      "bravery of Vijayala Chozla. They cheered each other and \n",
      "came back to fight.\n",
      "And that was it. The fickle Goddess of Victory changed \n",
      "her mind; her favor was now bestowed upon the Pallava \n",
      "army. The three kings gave up the idea of retreati ng beyond the Kollidam. They too entered the battle field. \n",
      "Soon the Pandiya army began its retreat. They did not stop \n",
      "till they reached the borders of their Pandiya Territories.\n",
      "Ganga Prithvi-pathi performed various deeds of valor that \n",
      "day. He established his brave fame and gave up his life in \n",
      "the field.They erected a hero stone in his memory in the \n",
      "battlefield. Later it was built into a memorial -temple or \n",
      "palli padai.\n",
      "That gory battlefield lay waste for a few years; not a weed \n",
      "grew on that land. People a voided going near the place. \n",
      "After a while, forest began claiming the land for itself. \n",
      "Trees and creepers began growing thickly around the \n",
      "memorial temple. Wolves took up abode among the \n",
      "bushes. Owls and bats lived in the dark branches of tall \n",
      "trees. In the course of time, no one went near that temple. \n",
      "Over the years the building began to crumble. Soon it \n",
      "turned into ruins. By the times of our story, the place had \n",
      "become a totally deserted ruin in the middle of a forest.\n",
      "Azlvar-adiyan reached the ruined me morial when darkness \n",
      "was setting in. The gargoyles carved on the upper walls of \n",

      "that brave Vaishnava was not one to be frightened easily. \n",
      "He jumped up and climbed on to the roof of the structure. \n",
      "He then hid himself carefully amidst the branches of a tree \n",
      "that covered the roof. He kept watch in all directions. \n",
      "Soon, his eyes were able to peer into the darkness and \n",

      "One hour, two hours and even three hours passed after \n",
      "sunset. The darkness around him was suffocating. Now \n",
      "and then he heard the rasping sound of forest trees: \n",
      "branches rubbed against each other. There! a wild -dog was \n",
      "climbing a tree. An owl hooted; bats screeche d. Birds \n",
      "frightened by the wild-dog beat their wings loudly as they \n",
      "tried to perch on higher branches. Wolves had begun to \n",
      "howl.\n",
      "He heard a noise above his head: looked up. Some small \n",
      "animal -- lizard or squirrel jumped to a different branch. A \n",
      "small patch of the clear sky could be seen through the \n",
      "branches of the tree. Stars twinkled and peeped down. In \n",
      "that silent, dark forest the stars seemed to extend a friendly \n",
      "smile towards him. Therefore, Thirumalai Nambi Azlvar -\n",
      "adiyan looked up at the stars and sta rted talking softly: \n",
      "\"Oh! My dear star friends! Today you seem to be laughing \n",
      "at the foolishness of these human beings on this earth. You \n",
      "have good reason to laugh! You might remember that \n",
      "horrible battle which took place in this very spot a hundred \n",
      "years ago; and how the whole area was a wretched ruin of \n",
      "blood and death. Perhaps you were surprised at mankind \n",
      "and their petty enmities! You wondered why they \n",
      "butchered each other to create rivers of red. It is called \n",
      "bravery! Even a hundred years after a man 's death they \n",
      "consider him an `Enemy' -- they referred to it as the \n",
      "`Enemy memorial'. They are going to meet near the enemy 9memorial and talk and conspire of more harm to the living \n",
      "in the name of the dead! Oh you twinkling lights of the \n",
      "skies! Why won't you laugh? Yes. Laugh as much as you \n",
      "wish. Dear God! Is my coming here a big waste? Is the \n",
      "whole night going to pass like this? Are those men, whom \n",
      "I expected, coming here, or not? Did I hear wrong? Did I \n",
      "not see correct? Or did those men who made the sign of \n",
      "the fish change their plans and go some place else? -- What \n",
      "disappointment? Disappointment? I cannot forgive myself \n",
      "if I am cheated today... Ah! ... I think I can see some light \n",
      "in that direction. What is it? The light is now hidden. No. I \n",
      "can see it. No doubt now. Someone is coming here; he is \n",
      "holding a torch of burning twigs. No, not one man -- I hear \n",
      "two men. My waiting has not been wasted.\"\n",
      "The two men who came crossed the path and went beyond \n",
      "the memorial temple. They stopped in the midst of a smal l \n",
      "clearing nearby. One fellow sat down. The man holding \n",
      "the lighted twigs looked around. There was no doubt: he \n",
      "was expecting some others. After sometime, two others \n",
      "came and joined them. They must have been very brave \n",
      "men; men who had come to that spot se veral times before. \n",
      "Otherwise, they could not have found their way in that \n",
      "darkness in that forest. Those who came first and the late \n",
      "comers talked amongst themselves. But, Azlvar -adiyan \n",
      "could not hear a single word! Oh dear! All my effort seems \n",
      "useless. I cannot even see those men clearly. What shall I \n",
      "do?\n",
      "Two more men joined them very soon. They talked of \n",
      "something to each other. One of the men who came last, \n",
      "had a bag in one hand. He opened the string tied around his \n",
      "bag and poured its contents on the g round! Gold coins \n",
      "shone brightly in the light of the burning twigs. The man \n",
      "who dropped the coins laughed like one possessed: \n",
      "\"My friends! We are about to destroy the Chozla Kingdom \n",
      "using Chozla gold! Isn't it funny?\" He laughed loudly \n",
      "again.\n",
      "\"Ravidasa, don't make such a racket! Let us talk softly,\" \n",
      "said another.\n",
      "\"Fine! What does it matter how we talk in this place? If \n",
      "anybody hears us, it will be owls and bats; wolves and \n",
      "wild-dogs; luckily they cannot repeat what they hear!\" \n",
      "Ravidasa laughed even more  loudly. \n",
      "\"Maybe. But, it is better to talk softly.\"\n",
      "They started talking amongst themselves, softly. Azlvar -\n",
      "adiyan felt that it was a waste to sit on top of that roof \n",
      "without hearing anything. He must get down and go near \n",
      "the clearing to listen to their  talk. He must manage to avoid \n",
      "the danger from such activity. Azlvar -adiyan started down \n",
      "from the roof top. His stocky body disturbed the tree \n",

      "\"How did you find that?\"\n",
      "\"One of the friends of my  younger master Kandamaran \n",

      "he ordered me to go to the south shore and procure a horse \n",

      "\"When the ferry boat on the Kollidam was about to leave,\n",
      "that fellow came and joined us in the boat. He exchanged \n",

      "doubted my conclusions about him being one of us. It \n",
      "appeared as if he was waiting for me on the south shore of \n",

      "use any weapon in your hands to pierce his heart and kill \n",
      "him! If you carry no weapon, use your bare hands to choke \n",

      "to a cliff top and push him t o death. Kill him mercilessly, like you would any poisonous snake, lizard or scorpion. \n",
      "More commendable, if you can give him up as a human \n",

      "\"Whose spy?\"\n",
      "\"I was not sure myself, for a long time I suspected him to \n",

      "\"All her devotions are rubbish! That old Queen's devotion \n",
      "to Shiva is as big a masquerade as this topknot fellow's \n",
      "Vaishnava fanaticism! She is a fiend who is hostile to her \n",
      "own son. That is why her very own brother, Lord \n",
      "Mazlavaraya of Mazluvoor quarrelled wit h her; he now \n",
      "belongs to that Pazluvoor fellow's group.\"\n",
      "\"Mr. Ravidasa, are there any others like that Vaishnava \n",
      "extremist?\"\n",
      "\"There is an astrologer in Kudanthai. I suspect that fellow. \n",
      "He pretends to foretell the future by astrology to one and \n",
      "all and discovers their secrets. None of you should ever go \n",
      "to him. If you go to him, you will surely be hoodwinked.\"\n",
      "\"Whose spy is he? What do you think?\"\n",
      "\"I have not been able to find out that! Perhaps he works for \n",

      "concerned about that astrologer. He cannot do much harm \n",
      "to us. I am apprehensive about that Vaishnava fellow. He \n",

      "Azlvar-adiyan, hidden under the hollow tree root, heard all \n",
      "this; his whole body was drenched in sweat and he \n",
      "shivered with fright. He doubted if he could ever escape \n",
      "with his life from that forest. To top it all, he felt like \n",
      "sneezing; just at that time! He tried as much as he could to \n",
      "control that wicked sneeze. He st uffed his face into his \n",
      "scarf and \"Aatch\"  he sneezed. \n",
      "At that time the gentle breeze had died. The whispering \n",
      "trees were quiet. The quiet \"Aatch\" was heard very clearly \n",

      "and said, \"There is some noi se near that marudai tree. Take \n",
      "the light over there and see what it is.\"2The man holding the lighted twigs came towards the tree. \n",
      "As he came closer and closer, the light increased. He had \n",

      "completely on Nambi. Then, what will happen? It would \n",
      "be impossible to escape with his life.\n",
      "Azlvar-adiyan's heart beat faster and faster. He eyes looked \n",

      "Up there, on that low branch above him, ... another giant \n",
      "bat was hanging upside down! Quickly, he stretched his \n",

      "had a good idea!\n",
      "As soon as the man with the torch took another step and \n",

      "torch of twigs fell to the ground. The light dimmed. The \n",
      "man, his face beaten by the strong wings of that huge bat, \n",
      "started screaming. The noise of several men coming closer, \n",
      "running closer, could be heard. Azlvar -adiyan also began \n",

      "That maiden -- whom I saw at the astrologer's house and \n",
      "met on the banks of the river -- whom does she resemble? \n",
      "...  Could it be possible? -- absolute foolishness! It can \n",

      "Cauvery, looking across the river to see the town on the \n",
      "northern bank. The fertility and beauty of that country \n",
      "overpowered his heart. He asked a passerby and confirmed \n",
      "that it was indeed Thiru -vai-aru. All that he had heard \n",
      "about that place seemed to be paltry compared to reality.\n",
      "The description of that town by Gnana -sambanda in his \n",
      "Thevaram poems could be recognized in the actuality. \n",
      "There was no change in three hundred years. \n",
      "Look at those luscious grov es of trees on the Cauvery \n",
      "bank. How big are the fruits hanging from the trunk and \n",
      "branches of the jack-tree! There is nothing like this in the \n",
      "dry Thondai region! Look at those monkeys gathered in \n",
      "these fertile lands. How delightful to see them jump from \n",
      "tree to tree! I remember the descriptions in Gnana -\n",
      "sambanda's poems: \n",
      "Maidens dance on the stages set in the street -corners of \n",
      "Thiru-vai-aru. Song and music accompany that dance with \n",
      "melodious drumbeats; Monkeys hearing those drums \n",
      "(mattalam) think that the skies are thundering with an \n",
      "approaching storm: they climb to the top of palm trees and \n",
      "look up at the skies waiting for the rains!\n",
      "How appropriate that description is even now? Look at \n",
      "those long-tailed monkeys scampering among tree -tops. I \n",
      "can hear the sounds of music and dance from the town! \n",
      "Along with the melody of the veena, flute and other such \n",
      "instruments, I can hear the sounds of dancing feet and \n",
      "ankle bells! The dancers here are not frenzied like the \n",
      "gypsy dancers of Kadamboor. This is classica l dance --decorous Bharata Natyam in full dignity. The music is \n",
      "from established classical culture. I can even hear the tap -\n",
      "tap of dance teachers beating time as their students \n",
      "practice!\n",
      "Teachers keep time, while beguiling damsels dance;Poets speak enchanting verse, making every sculpted stone come alive;Such accomplished people stroll in the streets of Thiru -vai-aru.\n",
      "Aha! Gnana-sambanda was a good devotee of Shiva but, \n",
      "more than that he was an connoisseur of the arts! This \n",
      "town is exactly as he descri bed it! I must stay in this town \n",
      "at least for tonight and enjoy this music and dance and I \n",
      "must worship at the shrines of the Lord of the five -rivers \n",
      "and the Lady who nurtured justice. Look at all those \n",
      "devotees at prayers on the banks of the Cauvery. How \n",
      "elegant they look with their foreheads adorned with broad \n",
      "ashen marks! Their chants of \"Namasivaya\" drown the \n",
      "sounds of the music and dance. Look, someone is singing \n",
      "the Thevaram songs so exquisitely. This town seems to be \n",
      "created by the Gods just for musi c and song! I must stay \n",
      "here tonight. What is the use of hurrying to Tanjore? I \n",
      "don't know if I can even enter the fort? Even if I manage to \n",
      "go in, will I be able to meet the Emperor? The two Lords \n",
      "of Pazluvoor are said to guard the Emperor as if in prison\n",
      "... Let me cross the Cauvery and go north.\n",
      "When Vandiya Devan came to this conclusion, something \n",
      "happened. A palanquin was approaching along the \n",
      "Cauvery from the west. Footmen and guards walked in \n",
      "front and behind the palanquin. A suspicion crossed \n",
      "Vandiya Devan's mind. He waited at the same spot till the \n",
      "palanquin came nearer. His surmise was correct. He could \n",
      "see the sign of the palmtree emblazoned upon the outer \n",
      "screens of the covered palanquin. \n",
      "Yes! This palanquin must be coming from Kadamboor! \n",
      "They must have come by some other route, while I came \n",
      "through Kudanthai. But, there is no sign of Lord \n",
      "Pazluvoor! Maybe he is delayed somewhere on the way.\n",
      "The palanquin turned south on to the Tanjore road. That \n",
      "decided it -- Vandiya Devan abandoned the idea of \n",
      "tarrying at Thiru-vai-aru. He decided to follow that \n",
      "palanquin. Why did he decide to do so? Even he did not \n",
      "know at that time! He was sure that Prince Madurandaka \n",
      "was seated inside the palanquin. His feelings of disgust \n",
      "about the Prince increased. Still , he might find some good \n",
      "opportunity if he followed the palanquin. The bearers \n",
      "might put down the palanquin or the Prince might emerge \n",
      "for some reason or other. He could make his acquaintance \n",
      "and it might help him in entering the fort at Tanjore and \n",
      "meeting the Emperor. \n",
      "I must speak and put up a pretense suitable to achieve my \n",
      "goal. If I don't use such strategy and conniving I cannot \n",
      "complete my assigned task; particularly in such political \n",
      "matters.4Therefore, he let the palanquin and its guards go ahea d and \n",
      "then followed them at a little distance. But no expected \n",
      "opportunity arose. They had already crossed the remaining \n",
      "four rivers between Thiru -vai-aru and Tanjore. The \n",
      "palanquin was not put down. The bearers walked steadily. \n",
      "He could soon see the rampa rts and gates of the outer fort \n",
      "of Tanjore in the distance. Once the palanquin enters the \n",
      "fort, nothing can be done. He must do something bold and \n",
      "fearless. \n",
      "What can happen? Will they chop off my head? It's alright \n",
      "if they do so -- there is no point going back with my life if \n",
      "I am unable to complete my assigned task. As a basis for \n",
      "all this thought, Vandiya Devan had a certain anger and \n",
      "disgust about the prince in the palanquin. His hands itched \n",
      "to tear apart the curtains of the palanquin and expose the \n",
      "fact that the person inside was not a woman but a full \n",
      "grown man! His heart was agitated!\n",
      "While he was considering various options to execute his \n",
      "intentions, one of the men in the retinue of the palanquin \n",
      "hesitated. He stared at Vandiya Devan seated on his  horse.\n",
      "\"Who are you Sir? You have been following us from \n",
      "Thiru-vai-aru?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"I am not following you Sir! I am going to Tanjore. \n",
      "Doesn't this road lead to Tanjore?\"\n",
      "\"Yes. This is the road to Tanjore; but, only important \n",
      "persons can use this road.  There is another road for \n",
      "commoners,\" said that man.\n",
      "\"Is that so? I too am quite an important person!\" said \n",
      "Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan.\n",
      "The man smiled upon hearing this, \"Why are you going to \n",
      "Tanjore?\" he asked.\n",
      "\"My uncle lives in Tanjore. I heard that  he was not keeping \n",
      "good health and am going to visit him.\"\n",
      "\"What does you uncle do in Tanjore? Is he in service at the \n",
      "Palace?\"\n",
      "\"Oh, no! He is an inn-keeper.\"\n",
      "\"Ah! Is that so! Then, why don't you go before us? Why do \n",
      "you follow us?\"\n",
      "\"My horse is tired Sir. That's why. Otherwise what \n",
      "pleasure do I have, to see your backsides?\"\n",
      "In the course of this conversation, Vandiya Devan came \n",
      "very close to the palanquin. An idea had occurred to him. \n",
      "He pulled in the reins, pressed both his legs against its \n",
      "flanks and pushed his horse towards the bearers carrying \n",
      "the end poles of the palanquin. They turned in fear and \n",
      "surprise. Vandiya Devan immediately started shouting \"Oh King, \n",
      "My Lord! My Sire! Your bearers are pushing against my \n",
      "horse! Help! Help! Oh dear!\" \n",
      "The screens shook and parted.\n",
      "*****\n",

      "Chapter 22 -- Velaikara Battalion Of Velirs\n",
      "First, the outer screens emblazoned with the palmtree \n",
      "symbol parted; next the silken inner curtains were pushed \n",
      "aside. The golden hand seen by Vallavarayan o nce before, \n",
      "the hand which had stunned him, could be seen once again. \n",
      "Thinking that it was no longer polite to be seated on his \n",
      "horse, Vandiya Devan climbed down. \n",
      "He ran up to the palanquin saying \"Prince! Prince! Your \n",
      "bearers ...\" and looked inside. He looked again; he blinked \n",
      "his eyelids and looked once again! His eyes were dazzled! \n",
      "His tongue tied itself into knots! Suddenly his throat felt \n",
      "parched. \"No. No! Princess! Princess of Pazluvoor! ... \n",
      "Your Ladyship, Princess of Pazluvoor! ... Your bearers and\n",
      "their horses dashed against my palanquin ...\" came the \n",
      "flustered blabberings.\n",
      "All this happened within the blink of an eyelid! By now \n",
      "the guards carrying the long spears ran up and surrounded \n",
      "Vandiya Devan. He realized that the men were around \n",
      "him; his hand automatically reached for his sword. But he \n",
      "could not take his eyes off the dazzling face of that \n",
      "enchantress behind the curtains!\n",
      "Yes; unlike his expectations, this time he unquestionably \n",
      "saw the beautiful figure of a young girl seated inside the \n",
      "palanquin! Girl means what a girl! Vandiya Devan hadn't \n",
      "known that such beauty, which could madden those who \n",
      "beheld it, could exist in this world.\n",
      "Fortunately, some nerve in his brain became active at that \n",
      "moment. An amazing idea rose in his mind. He decided  to \n",
      "make use of that idea. He made a tremendous effort and \n",
      "cleared his throat, bringing back speech to his tongue. \"I \n",
      "beg pardon! My Lady, aren't you the Young -Queen of \n",
      "Pazluvoor? I came this far to make thy acquaintance!\" \n",
      "spoke his tongue.\n",
      "A smile blossomed on the gentle face of the Young -Queen \n",
      "of Pazluvoor. A lotus bud, which was closed shut till that \n",
      "moment, opened slightly to reveal a string of tiny pearls. \n",
      "The radiance of that smile mesmerized our young warrior \n",
      "and absolutely bewildered him.\n",
      "The footmen surrounding him seemed to wait for the \n",
      "commands of their mistress. The Lady made a sign with \n",
      "her finger; they moved away a little and stood apart. Two \n",
      "men caught hold of the horse and waited.5That jewel among women, seated in the palanquin, looked \n",
      "at Vandiya Devan. Two sharp spear -points pierced his \n",
      "heart!\n",
      "\"Yes! I am the Young-Queen of Pazluvoor,\" said that \n",
      "Lady. What is that intoxicating stuff mixed into her voice? \n",
      "Why is my head spinning with such dizziness upon hearing \n",
      "her speak?\n",
      "\"What did you say just now? You appealed to me about \n",
      "something? About my bearers?\"\n",
      "Can the softness of Benaras silk, the intoxication of \n",
      "country liquor, the sweetness of forest honey and the flash \n",
      "of monsoon lightning blend like this into the voice of a \n",
      "young maid? It seems quite possible here...\n",
      "\"You said they dashed my palanquin against your horse?\"\n",
      "The mocking smile playing upon her coral red lips \n",
      "indicated that she was enjoying the joke. Vandiya Devan \n",
      "gained some courage because of it.\n",
      "\"Yes. Great Queen! These men d id that; my horse was \n",
      "petrified.\"\n",
      "\"You also look petrified! Go to the priest at the temple of \n",
      "Goddess Durga and ask him to exorcise you! You will \n",
      "overcome this terror!\"\n",
      "By now, Vandiya Devan had overcome his fear and even \n",
      "laughter came back! The Pazluvoo r Queen's expression \n",
      "had now changed: a smiling full -moon turned into blazing \n",
      "anger!\n",
      "\"Stop jesting. Tell the truth. Why did you push your horse \n",
      "against my palanquin and stop me?\"\n",
      "He had to give a plausible answer. If not... Luckily he had \n",
      "already concocted a story. In a soft voice, a deliberately \n",
      "soft voice, he spoke as if he did not wish others to hear his \n",
      "words: \"My Lady! Madam Nandini Devi! He... Mr. \n",
      "Azlvar-adiyan, that is ... Mr. Thirumalai, he ... he asked me \n",
      "to meet you! That is why I connived this strategy. Please \n",
      "forgive me. I beg pardon!\" \n",
      "As he said the words he examined her face carefully. He \n",
      "waited anxiously, to see the effect of his reply. It was like \n",
      "throwing a stone at a fruit tree. Will a ripe fruit fall? Or, \n",
      "would it be raw? Or, will the stone fall back on him? Or, \n",
      "will some unexpected thunder descend?\n",
      "The dark brows of the Pazluvoor Queen shot up -- surprise \n",
      "and fear filled her intoxicating eyes. The next instant, she \n",
      "seemed to have come to some decision.\n",
      "\"Fine! It is not safe to stop i n the middle of a road and talk. \n",
      "Come to my palace tomorrow. You can explain everything \n",
      "there.\"Vandiya Devan's heart filled with bliss. His intentions \n",
      "were about to be fulfilled, but there was no use in leaping \n",
      "across three fourths of an open well! He mu st leap across \n",
      "the remaining quarter.\n",
      "\"Madam! My Lady! They will not let me come inside the \n",
      "fortress! Neither will they let me enter the palace! What \n",
      "shall I do?\" he asked with some agitation.\n",
      "The Young-Queen of Pazluvoor instantly turned aside and \n",
      "picked up a silken purse lying next to her. She opened the \n",
      "bag and took out an ivory signet ring. Saying, \"If you show \n",
      "this they will let you into the fort and permit you to enter \n",
      "my palace,\" she gave him the ring. Vandiya Devan \n",
      "received it eagerly. For a secon d, he glanced at the ring \n",
      "with the sign of the palm tree. Then, he looked up to thank \n",
      "the lady. But, the screens were pulled shut once again.\n",
      "Ah! An eclipse swallows the full -moon slowly, bit by bit. \n",
      "But these silken screens have covered that eloquent \n",
      "radiance in one moment!\n",
      "\"Do not follow me anymore. It may be dangerous. Wait \n",
      "and come later,\" said that silken voice from inside the \n",
      "drapes.\n",
      "The palanquin moved on. The guards walked ahead, \n",
      "around it like before. Vandiya Devan stood by the \n",
      "roadside, holding the reins of his horse. His eyes noted that \n",
      "the Pazluvoor footman who had stopped to talk to him \n",
      "looked back several times; the message reached his inner \n",
      "brain. His outer brain revolved around the enchanting face \n",
      "of the Young-Queen of Pazluvoor. Did all t his truly \n",
      "happen? Was everything a pleasing dream? Can there be \n",
      "such beauty, such a ravishing form on this earth?\n",
      "Myth and fable talk of divine maidens -- heavenly beauties \n",
      "called Ramba, Urvasi and Menaka. There are tales about \n",
      "how those beautiful maidens  disturbed the penance of \n",
      "ascetics who foreswore all worldly pleasures. But in \n",
      "reality! ... There must be truth in the rumor about the Elder \n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor being a bonded slave to this ravishing \n",
      "lady. There is no surprise if it is true. What contrast \n",
      "between Lord Pazluvoor -- old and grey, with a body \n",
      "disfigured by scars of several battle wounds -- and this \n",
      "soft, gentle, dazzling maiden? What deeds will that old \n",
      "man perform, to obtain one smile from her?\n",
      "He waited for a long time by the roadside, mulling o ver \n",
      "such thoughts. Finally, he mounted his horse and slowly \n",
      "rode towards the gates of Tanjore.\n",
      "By sunset, he neared the main entrance to the city fort. The \n",
      "city extended for some distance before the fortress walls \n",
      "and gates. Market streets offering severa l kinds of goods \n",
      "for sale, residential streets of people engaged in various \n",
      "trades -- these successively surrounded the outer \n",
      "boundaries of the fort. All the streets were busy with the \n",
      "hustle and bustle of a large town:  people going hither and \n",
      "thither, merchants haggling over the price of goods they 6sold, carts and wagons drawn by hefty, well fed bullocks, \n",
      "horse drawn chariots, palanquins and litters filled the \n",
      "streets. \n",
      "Vandiya Devan was eager to enter those streets and \n",
      "experience the sights and sounds o f the new capital of the \n",
      "Chozlas; he wished to make the acquaintance of these city \n",
      "folk and become familiar with their ways. But, there was \n",
      "no time for all that now. He must first complete the \n",
      "assignment on which he had journeyed so far. Sightseeing \n",
      "must wait. With this determination he neared the main \n",
      "gates of Tanjore.\n",
      "The massive doors of the main gateway were closed shut \n",
      "at that time. The guards and gatekeepers outside were \n",
      "trying to maneuver the people making them stand in an \n",
      "orderly fashion on both si des of the street. The people \n",
      "complied and stood aside. Yes; instead of going about their \n",
      "own business they stood by the roadside as if in \n",
      "anticipation of some procession or parade. Men, Women, \n",
      "children and elderly -- everybody waited.\n",
      "For a short distance the street in front of the gateway was \n",
      "empty. The guards stood near the doorway. Vandiya \n",
      "Devan wished to find out what was happening. He did not \n",
      "wish to entangle himself with the gatekeepers when \n",
      "everyone else stood aside. Unnecessary dispute and trouble\n",
      "might come of it. The job on hand was more important \n",
      "than a joust. It was not the time to pick an unwanted \n",
      "quarrel.\n",
      "Therefore, he stood to one side at a spot where he could \n",
      "keep an eye on the gateway. The heady fragrance of \n",
      "flowers rose by his side. He l ooked around. A youth, \n",
      "wearing the symbols of a Saiva devotee, such as rudraksha \n",
      "beads around his neck and ashen marks on his forehead, \n",
      "stood by his side carrying two large baskets of flowers in \n",
      "both his hands.\n",
      "\"Thambi, why has everybody moved to one side  of the \n",
      "road? Is some procession or something coming this way?\" \n",
      "asked Vandiya Devan.\n",
      "\"Are you not from these parts, Sir?\"\n",
      "\"No. I come from the Thondai Territories.\"\n",
      "\"That's why you asked! It may be better if you also \n",
      "dismount and stand aside.\"\n",
      "Vandiya Devan jumped off his horse, thinking it would be \n",
      "easier to converse with that youth. \"Thambi why did you \n",
      "ask me to dismount?\"\n",
      "\"All these people are standing aside because the Velaikara \n",
      "Battalion of Velirs is about to emerge from the fort after \n",

      "\"Just to watch?\"\"Yes.\"\n",
      "\"Why shouldn't I watch while sitting upon my horse?\"\n",
      "\"You can. But, it is dangerous if the  men of the Velaikara \n",
      "Battalion see you.\"\n",
      "\"What danger? Will they abduct my horse?\"\n",
      "\"They will abduct the horse; even carry away men! \n",
      "Wicked fellows!\"\n",
      "\"Will they be allowed to carry away horse or man?\"\n",
      "\"What can one do but allow it? The word of those men of \n",

      "question them. Even the men of Pazluvoor do not  interfere \n",
      "in the affairs of the Velaikara Battalion of Velirs.\"\n",
      "At that time, a loud commotion and noise could be heard \n",
      "inside the fort. The sound of kettle -drums, blowing \n",
      "conches, pipes being played, horns being blown and \n",
      "marching drums being beaten min gled with loud, cheering, \n",
      "shouts raised by hundreds of men.\n",
      "Vandiya Devan had heard much about the brave warriors \n",
      "of the Velaikara Battalion. It was an important \n",
      "organization in the ancient Tamil nations, particularly in \n",
      "Chozla dominions. `Velaikaras' wer e the personal \n",
      "bodyguards of the ruling monarch. But there was an \n",
      "important difference between them and ordinary \n",
      "bodyguards. The men of this battalion had taken individual \n",
      "oaths to \"Personally guard the life and person of the king, \n",
      "giving up their own life  if the need arises.\" If something \n",
      "untoward happened to the king or his life, because of their \n",
      "carelessness or in spite of their guard, they had sworn to \n",
      "cut off their heads with their own sword and offer \n",
      "themselves as a sacrifice to the Goddess Durga. It was \n",
      "natural that such men, who had sworn such terrible oaths, \n",
      "were given ceratin privileges.\n",
      "The two large doors of the gateway opened with a loud \n",

      "crowded to that capital city from nations spreading across \n",
      "the lands between the North Pennar river and the southern \n",

      "across the seas. \n",
      "People crowded to the shops of vendors selling sweet -\n",
      "fritters, roasted meats and rice -cakes -- like flies hovering \n",
      "around sugar syrup -- as they bought the foodstuffs. Fruits 8like banana, mango and jack were heaped in mounds \n",
      "outside the shops. Words were not adequate to describe the \n",

      "frangipani, oleander, chrysanthemum and marigold, \n",

      "\"Oh! The name Tanjore Tali -kulattar seems familiar. Is it \n",
      "the same? Is it a large temple?\"\n",
      "\"No; it is a modest place. For some time now, only the \n",
      "temple of the Goddess Durga has been enjoying favor in \n",
      "Tanjore. Special worship, food offering, sacrifice, \n",
      "festivities, ceremony and carnival all take place there. The \n",
      "royal family and the Pazluvoor households have been \n",
      "patronizing that Durga temple. There are no such \n",
      "important patrons for the temple of Tali -kulattar. Not many \n",
      "people come to worship there...\"\n",
      "\"You are in service to deliver flowers. Do you get paid \n",
      "well for this?\"\n",
      "\"My family has subsidies for this service. From the times \n",
      "of my grandfather our family had grants from Emperor \n",
      "Gandara Aditya for delivering this flower -service. My \n",
      "mother and I have been continuing the practice.\"\n",
      "\"Is the temple of Tali-kulattar built in brick, or has it been \n",
      "renovated in granite?\" Vandiya Devan asked the question \n",
      "because he had seen several small brick -work temples \n",
      "being renovated in stone and decorated with granite \n",
      "sculpture.\n",
      "\"It is still brick-work. I have heard that it is soon to be \n",

      "possible. But, ...\"\"But what? Why did you stop?\"\n",
      "\"What is the use of repeating idle gossip? One must look \n",
      "around in all directions before talk ing in the daytime; at \n",
      "nighttime do not even open your mouth. This is a public \n",

      "heard by anyone.\"\n",
      "\"What secrets do we have to talk about?\" asked the youth, \n",
      "eyeing Vandiya Devan with some suspicion.\n",
      "Aha! This young man is very intelligent. It would be very \n",
      "useful to make friends with him. I can learn about several \n",
      "things from him. But I sho uld not raise useless doubts in \n",
      "his mind, thinking such thoughts, Vandiya Devan said, \n",
      "\"Yes, what secrets do we have? Nothing. Thambi, tonight I \n",
      "need a place to rest and sleep well. I have journeyed a long \n",
      "way and am very tired. Where can I stay? Can you he lp me \n",
      "by guiding me to a good rest house?\"\n",
      "\"There is no dearth of places to stay in this city. There are \n",

      "for the use of foreign visitors. But, Sir, if you would like \n",
      "...\"\n",
      "Before the youth could finish, Vandiya Devan interrupted, \n",
      "\"Thambi, what is your name?\"\n",
      "\"Amudan; Sendan Amudan.\"\n",
      "\"Oh! What a sweet name! My mouth tastes the sweetness \n",
      "just by hearing it. (Amudu meaning nectar.) Were you \n",
      "about to say that I could come to your house if I was \n",
      "willing?\"\n",
      "\"Yes; how did you know Sir?\"\n",
      "\"I have magic skills; that's how! Where is your house?\"\n",
      "\"Our gardens are in the suburbs, a little beyond the city \n",
      "limits. Our house is in the middle of the flower gardens,\" \n",
      "said Sendan Amudan.\n",
      "\"Ah! I must surely come to your house. I cannot rest in \n",
      "peace in this city commotion tonight. Moreover, I would \n",
      "like to make the acquaintance of that good woman who is \n",
      "mother to a good son like you!\"\n",
      "\"She who gave birth to me is indeed a good woman; but \n",
      "she is unfortunate...\"\n",
      "\"Dear, dear! Why do you say that? Perhaps your father \n",
      "is...?\"9\"Yes, my father is dead. But that is not the reason. My \n",
      "mother is unfortunate from birth. You will know when you \n",
      "see her. Come Sir, let us go.\"\n",
      "They walked for about half an hour and reached th e flower \n",
      "gardens beyond the city limits. The fragrance of night \n",
      "blooming flowers made Vandiya Devan's head swim with \n",
      "uncommon exhilaration.  The noise and din of the city was \n",
      "not heard in that pleasing grove.\n",
      "He could see a small tiled house in the middle  of the \n",
      "flower garden. Two thatched huts were also seen close by. \n",
      "Two families who helped in the garden lived in those huts. \n",
      "Amudan called out to one of those men and asked him to \n",
      "feed and water Vandiya Devan's horse and tie it to a tree \n",
      "after grooming it.\n",
      "He then led his new friend into the house. As soon as he \n",
      "saw Amudan's mother, Vandiya Devan realized her \n",
      "misfortune. She was mute without any speech; she was \n",
      "also deaf without any sense of hearing. But he saw her \n",
      "gentle, good looking face filled with a k indness and love. \n",
      "Her eyes shone bright with a keen intelligence. Was it not \n",
      "the caprice of nature to endow a superior intellect on those \n",
      "with some bodily handicap?\n",
      "That elderly woman understood that her visitor had come \n",
      "from foreign parts by the signs ma de by Amudan. Her \n",
      "expressive face showed welcome and concern for him.\n",
      "Soon, she placed platters of fresh banana leaves before \n",
      "them and served a meal. First came string -cake \n",
      "accompanied by sweetened, freshly squeezed, coconut \n",
      "milk. Vandiya Devan felt that he had not eaten such \n",
      "delicacies in his lifetime! He ate about ten or twelve cakes \n",
      "and drank a liter of coconut milk. Sour sauce with tubers \n",
      "and steamed millet flour followed. He did them justice. \n",
      "Even so, his hunger was not satiated. In the end he partook\n",
      "of a quarter measure of cooked rice and a liter of yogurt! \n",
      "Only then did he rise from his platter.\n",
      "While eating, he asked about and gleaned several facts \n",
      "from Amudan. He enquired about who besides the \n",
      "Emperor and his retinue lived in Tanjore Fort.\n",
      "The mansions of the Elder and Younger Lords of \n",
      "Pazluvoor were inside. The officers and clerks who were \n",
      "attached to the treasury and granary lived inside because \n",
      "the royal treasury, counting house and granary were inside \n",
      "the fort. The confidante and friend of Su ndara Chozla, his \n",
      "Prime Minister, Honorable Anirudda Brahma -raya as well \n",
      "as the Chief Clerk of edicts and proclamations also lived in \n",
      "the inner fort. Soldiers guarding the fort of Tanjore under \n",
      "the command of the Younger Lord Pazluvoor, lived inside \n",
      "with their families. \n",
      "Besides this, the streets of the goldsmiths, silversmiths, \n",
      "jewelers and dealers in precious gems and coin merchants \n",
      "were inside the main fort. Hundreds of clerks and writers \n",
      "working for the Tax Ministry under the Elder Lord Pazluvoor were also provided accommodation within. In \n",
      "addition to all this, the famous Temple of the Goddess \n",
      "Durga Nisumbasudhini was in one corner of the interior \n",
      "fort. The temple priests, servants, dancing girls and \n",
      "musicians attached to the temple and their families, lived \n",
      "inside near the temple.\n",
      "Hearing about all this, Vandiya Devan asked, \"Are all the \n",
      "ministers and officials inside the fort today?\"\n",
      "\"How can everyone be inside? They will be going out and \n",
      "coming back in the course of their various duties. For \n",
      "sometime now, the Honorable Prime Minister, Anirudda \n",
      "Brahma-raya, has not been inside the fort. It is said that he \n",
      "is gone to the Chera Kingdom. The Elder Lord of \n",
      "Pazluvoor went out four days ago. Rumor says that he has \n",
      "gone to the central provinces beyond the Ko llidam.\"\n",
      "\"He might be back now. Do you know?\"\n",
      "\"The palanquin of the Young -Queen of Pazluvoor came \n",
      "back this evening. I saw it near the gates myself. But there \n",
      "was no sign of Lord Pazluvoor. Perhaps he is delayed \n",
      "somewhere and will come back tomorrow.\"\n",
      "\"Thambi! Does Prince Madurandaka also live inside the \n",
      "fort?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, his mansion is next to the Pazluvoor Palace. Isn't he \n",
      "the bridegroom married to the daughter of the Younger \n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor?\"\n",
      "\"Oh! Is that true? I did not know that till now!\"\n",
      "\"Not many people know it. Because of the Emperor's ill \n",
      "health the wedding was not celebrated with pomp.\"\n",
      "\"Good. Is the Prince inside the fort tonight?\"\n",
      "\"Must be. However, Prince Madurandaka does not emerge \n",
      "from the fort very often. People cannot see him commonly. \n",
      "It is said that he is involved in his devotions to God Shiva \n",
      "and that he spends his time in meditation, yoga and \n",
      "worship.\"\n",
      "\"But he has entered into matrimony after all these years.\"\n",
      "\"Yes, that was somewhat surprising. People also say that \n",
      "the mind and intentions of the bridegroom transformed \n",
      "completely after the marriage! Why should we bother \n",
      "about that? Better not gossip about the nobility.\"\n",
      "Vandiya Devan desired to learn of several other things \n",
      "from Sendan Amudan. But he did not wish to pry too \n",
      "much and raise his suspicions. The friendship of such a \n",
      "amiable youth would be very useful to him. It was his \n",
      "good luck that he found such a convenient and comfortable \n",
      "place to stay in Tanjore. Why should he spoil the good \n",
      "fortune? Moreover, tiredness of the long j ourney joined \n",
      "forces with the sleeplessness of the previous night. His 0eyes were drowsy with sleep and exhaustion. Realizing his \n",
      "state, Amudan quickly made up a bed for him.\n",
      "In the drowsiness of sleep, towards the end, Vandiya \n",
      "Devan's mind glimpsed the gl amorous face of the Young -\n",
      "Queen of Pazluvoor. \n",
      "Oh God! What beauty! What scintillation! His experience \n",
      "of being tongue tied and immobile upon suddenly seeing \n",
      "that ravishing, enchanting face reminded him of another \n",
      "experience. \n",
      "As a child, once when he wa s walking through some \n",
      "woods he suddenly spied a cobra swaying its raised hood. \n",
      "Its beauty was incomparable. The attraction was beyond \n",
      "description. Vandiya Devan had not been able to take his \n",
      "eyes off the swaying hood of the snake. He could not even \n",
      "blink his eyelids. He stood there as if hypnotized; the \n",
      "snake continued its swaying dance. As the snake swayed, \n",
      "his body began to sway in rhythm -- what would be the \n",
      "result, no one knew. Suddenly a mongoose pounced upon \n",
      "the snake. A furious contest between the t wo started. Using \n",
      "the chance the boy ran to his escape...\n",
      "Dear me! What a comparison! How can I equate the \n",
      "majestic beauty of this maid without equal in the world, \n",
      "with a swaying snake? Her gentle, tender face will quell all \n",
      "hungers of those who catch a g limpse of it! ... I am going \n",
      "to meet her tomorrow! How sweet her voice! Her beauty is \n",
      "extraordinary. But, how about the other maid whom I saw \n",
      "at the astrologer's house and on the banks of the Arisil? ... \n",
      "Her face too, was radiant. It too glowed with a love liness. \n",
      "Both are exquisite beauties; but what a difference! That \n",
      "has dignity and decorum; while this has allure and \n",
      "glamour.\n",
      "Thus, while his heart was comparing the two attractive \n",
      "women he had met recently, a third maid intervened. That \n",
      "merciless tyrant, the Empress of Sleep took charge of him \n",

      "Vandiya Devan slept through the night like a log and woke \n",
      "up only after sunrise in the morning. Even after waking, he \n",
      "was lying down without the will to get up. The light breeze \n",
      "blew briskly, leaves of the creepers and trees rubbed \n",
      "against each other making a swishing murmur. With that \n",
      "background drone, a young voice was melodiously singing \n",
      "a pleasing Thevaram poem composed by the Saint Sundara \n",
      "Murti. \n",
      "O Lord of golden hued body with a tiger skin draped around the waist;Upon matted locks, burnished red, you wear the shining crescent!\n",
      "On hearing the song, Vandiya Devan opened his eyes and \n",
      "looked out. Outside, in the garden he saw tall konnai trees(the bignonia family) draped with wreaths of golden \n",
      "yellow flowers! Sendan Amudan held a large flower tote in \n",
      "one hand and a long bamboo pole in the other. While he \n",
      "sang, his hands plucked the yellow flowers with the \n",
      "harvest pole. He appeared neatly dress ed, having risen and \n",
      "bathed early, his forehead was adorned with broad ashen \n",

      "Vandiya Devan rose from his bed thinking about \n",
      "Amudan's unfortunate mother who could not hear the \n",

      "immersed in astonish-ment. Kanchi City (from where he \n",
      "came) was the capital of the ancient Pallava Empire. It had \n",
      "withstood the attack of several enemies. The buildings, \n",
      "mansions and palaces in that city were now badly \n",
      "maintained, dilapidated ruins. Of course many of them \n",

      "cluster of rubies enhanced by pearls and diamonds. Trees \n",
      "in the gardens and by the roadside had grown luxuriously \n",
      "tall, nourished by that fertile red-dust. Coconut and areca \n",

      "That was good news. He must somehow meet the Emperor \n",
      "before the Elder Lord Pazluv oor returns. How ...? An idea \n",
      "occurred to him. The worry lines vanished immediately \n",
      "and a mischievous smile and joy blossomed on his face.\n",
      "He did not have to wander much to reach the Emperor's \n",
      "palace. He kept walking in the direction of the large tiger -\n",

      "a wonderful building. A palace comparable to that of the \n",

      "Several roads from all directions came to meet in a large \n",

      "Catching sight of a group of men behind him, he turned \n",

      "his elephant stable. The Lord of the Gods saw the \n",
      "thousands of beasts standing there like little hillocks and \n",
      "was confused, `Which one shall I choose?' Seeing his \n",

      "intentions publicly.\n",
      "After all such arrangements were made, a surprising \n",

      "The beauty, modesty, virtue and piety of that jewel among \n",
      "maids, Sembiyan Madevi, att racted him. In his advanced \n",

      "marriage a child was born in due course. They named the \n",

      "{0: 'Ponniyin Selvan\\n', 1: ' Aadi Festival\\nWe welcome our readers to get into the boat of \\nimagination and go sailing down the flood of sourceless, \\nendless time. Let us travel a century for every second and \\nquickly reach the times of a thousand years before the \\npresent.\\nIn the southern end of Thirumunaipadi, which lies in \\nbetween the Thondai Kin gdom and the Chozla Kingdom, \\nabout two leagues far to the west of Thillai Chittrambalam, \\n(Chidambaram Town) there spreads an ocean -like \\nreservoir. It is known as Veera Narayana Lake. It is about \\na league and a half long north to south and about half a \\nleague wide east to west. Time has twisted its name: for \\nthese days the reservoir is known as Veeraanatthu Lake.   \\nIn the windy months of Aadi -Aavani (August), when new \\nfloods fill the reservoir to almost overflow, anyone who \\nlooks at the Veera Narayana lake  will surely recall with \\npride and astonishment the splendid deeds of our ancestors \\nin Tamil Nadu. Did those ancients do things merely for the \\nwelfare of themselves and the people of their own times? \\n... They fulfilled tasks that would benefit thousands of\\nfuture generations in their sacred motherland. \\nOn the 18th day of the month of Aadi, in the early hours of \\nthe evening, a young warrior, mounted on a horse, was \\nriding down the banks of this ocean -like Veera Narayana \\nLake. He belonged to the Vaanar clan  which is famous in \\nthe history of the gallant Tamils. \\nVallavarayan Vandiya Devan was his name. Having \\ntravelled a long distance and being worn and weary, his \\nhorse was walking along rather slowly. The young cavalier \\ndid not seem concerned about this. Th e sprawling reservoir \\nhad so enchanted his heart!\\nIt was common for rivers of the Chozla Kingdom to run \\nwith flood waters touching both banks during the Aadi \\nmonth festival of Padhinettam Perukku. The lakes fed by \\nthese rivers would also be filled to capa city, with waves \\njostling and colliding upon their embankments. Waters \\nfrom the river called North Cauvery by the devout, but \\ncommonly known as Kollidam, rushed into the Veera \\nNarayana Lake, through the Vadavaru stream and made it \\na turbulent sea.\\nSeventy four floodgates on the lake distributed the bounty \\nvia aqueducts to distant tracts of the country side. With \\nthese irrigation waters from the lake, activities such as \\nploughing, sowing and seed transplanting were being \\ncarried out as far as the eye could see.\\nHere and there, the song of farmers who were ploughing \\nand women who were transplanting created a pleasant and \\njoyous music. Listening to all this, Vandiya Devan was riding quite slowly, without prodding his tired horse. As \\nsoon as he had climbed the  embankment, he had started \\ncounting the floodgates with the intention of finding out if \\npopular claims, which declared the lake to have seventy -\\nfour floodgates, were true! After having come about one \\nand a half leagues along the bank, he had counted seven ty \\ngates.\\nAha! How huge is this lake? How wide and how long? Can \\nwe not say that the tanks built by the great Pallava \\nmonarchs in the Thondai Kingdom are mere ponds and \\npools compared with this immense reservoir? Did not \\nPrince Raja-aditya son of King Paranthaka who conquered \\nMadurai, think of building this great tank to conserve the \\nwaters of the North Cauvery which were going wastefully \\ninto the sea? And did he not execute his thinking into \\naction? How great a genius he must have been! Who can \\nwe compare to his brave nobility! During the battle at \\nTakkolam, did he not, riding an elephant go to the \\nforefront and single handed, enter combat? And in the \\ncourse of that confrontation did he not receive enemy \\nspears on his chest and give up his very life? And b ecause \\nof it did he not get the title Deva who reposed atop the \\nelephant as he departed for the heavens meant for the \\nbrave? These kings of the Chozla Dynasty are remarkable! \\nThey were just as just as they were brave! And as in justice \\nthey excelled in the veneration of their Gods. \\nVallavarayan Vandiya Devan\\'s shoulders swelled with \\npride when he thought of his good fortune in having \\nreceived the friendship of a Chozla prince of such a \\ndynasty. Just like the waves that dashed against the banks \\nof the lake because of the swift western breeze, his heart \\ntoo bubbled with gratification and pride. Thinking all such \\nthoughts Vandiya Devan reached the southern end of \\nVeera Narayana Lake. \\nThere he could view the panorama of the Vadavaru stream \\nseparating from the North Cauvery and falling into the \\nlake. For a short distance inside the embankment, the lake \\nshore was silted forming a sandy beach. A number of \\ncasuarina trees and wood -apple trees had been planted on \\nthe beach so that rising flood waters would not des troy the \\nembankment. Nanal reeds had grown thickly along the \\nwater\\'s edge. From a distance, the scenic view of the \\nrushing waters from the tree lined North River merging \\ninto the lake in the south -west, seemed like a colorful, \\nnewly created painting. Vandi ya Devan saw a few other \\nthings that increased the pleasing joyousness of this \\nenchanting scene. Was it not the day of the Aadi Festival? \\nCrowds of people from nearby villages, dragging their \\ncarts covered with canopies of sandal -colored, supple \\ncoconut-leaves, were coming there. Men, women, children \\nand even several elderly folks all wearing new clothes and \\nvividly dressed in various ways had come. Bunches of \\nfragrant flowers, such as the hearts of country cactus, \\nchrysanthemum, jasmine, gardenia, champaka  and \\niruvatchi decorated the braids of women. Several had come with families bringing stewed rice and \\nfancy picnic foods. Some stood by the water\\'s edge and ate \\ntheir picnic rice-dishes from platters of plantain -flower \\npetals. Others, more brave, had ven tured further into the \\nwater to cross over to the bank of the Vadavaru. Some \\nchildren threw the platters from which they had eaten into \\nthe floodgates and clapped their hands with laughter to see \\nthe petals float through the gates to be rushed onto the \\ncanals. Some mischievous young men plucked the flowers \\noff the heads of their loved ones and threw them into the \\nwater, merely to see them being cast upon the shore. \\nVallavarayan Vandiya Devan stood there watching all this \\nfor a while. He listened with an e ager ear when some of \\nthe girls with pleasant voices sang. They sang traditional \\nboat-songs and flood-songs as well as folk songs like \\nKummi and Sindhu.\\nCome, oh ye young maidens,  Look at the North river bubbling by!\\nCome watch, oh ye friends, Look at the White river rushing by!\\nCome, oh come all ye girls, To look at the Cauvery tumbling by!\\nSuch flood-songs pleasingly flooded the ears of Vandiya \\nDevan. Others sang ballads about the bravery and fame of \\nChozla kings. Some girls sang of Vijayala Chozl a who had \\nfought in thirty-two battles and had worn his ninety -six \\nbody wounds like ornaments. Others sang acclaiming the \\nbravery of his son, Aditya Chozla, and how he constructed \\nsixty-four Shiva temples all along the Cauvery - from \\nwhere it rose till it mingled into the sea. One girl sang the \\nfame of King Aditya\\'s son, Paranthaka Chozla, who had \\nnot only conquered the Pandiya, Pallava and Chera kings \\nbut had also sent an army to Lanka to hoist his victory flag. \\nWhen each girl sang, several people stood ar ound her \\nlistening with rapt attention. They applauded with loud \\nshouts of \"Ah, ah\" and expressed their happiness!\\nAn elderly woman noticed Vandiya Devan who was sitting \\non his horse and listening to all this. \"Thambi! You seem \\nto have come from a long di stance; you are tired! Come \\ndown from your horse to eat this stewed rice,\" she said.\\nImmediately several young girls noticed our youthful \\ntraveller. They whispered amongst themselves about his \\nappearance and laughed merrily. Vandiya Devan was \\novercome by a certain mortification on one side and \\ndelight on the other. For a moment he considered \\ndismounting and eating the food offered by the old \\nwoman. If he did so, the young maids would surely gather \\naround to tease and laugh. \\nSo what? Is it easy to behold so many beautiful maidens in \\none place? Even their laughter and teasing would be \\nheavenly music. In Vandiya Devan\\'s eyes all those girls on \\nthe lake shore appeared like the heavenly nymphs Ramba \\nand Menaka!At the same time he noticed something towards th e south-\\nwest along the flow of River Vadavaru and hesitated. \\nAbout seven or eight large boats with white, spreading \\nsails filled with the breeze were coming swiftly like white \\nswans floating with wide -spread wings. \\nAll the people engaged in various merri ments turned to \\navidly look in the direction from which the boats were \\ncoming. One of the boats came forward more swiftly and \\nreached the lake shore where the embankment turned west. \\nSeveral well-built footmen carrying sharp & shiny spears \\nwere in that boat. Some of them jumped on to the lake \\nshore and started shoving the people with shouts of \"Go! \\nMove!\" Before being pushed around too much, the people \\npicked up their containers and belongings and quickly \\nstarted climbing upon the bank. Vandiya Devan could not \\nunderstand any of this. Who were these men? Who were \\ncoming in the sailboats behind them? Where were they \\ncoming from? Perhaps they belonged to the royal \\nhousehold?\\nVallavarayan Vandiya Devan approached an elderly man \\nleaning upon his cane by the bank . \"Sir, whose men are \\nthese? And whose boats are those coming behind like a \\nschool of swans? Why are these footmen chasing away the \\npeople? And why are the people hurrying away?\" came his \\nquestions, one upon the other.\\n\"Thambi! Do you not know? There is a  flag flying in the \\nmiddle of those sailboats. See what is embossed on it!\" \\nsaid the elder.\\n\"Seems like a palm tree.\"\\n\"It is a palm tree! Don\\'t you know that the palmtree -flag \\nbelongs to the Lord of Pazluvoor?\"\\n\"Is it the great warrior, Lord Pazluvoor, who is coming?\" \\nasked Vandiya Devan in a startled voice.\\n\"It must be so. Who else could raise the palmtree -flag and \\ncome?\" said the elderly man.\\nVandiya Devan\\'s eyes opened wide with immeasurable \\nsurprise as he looked towards the boats. Vallavarayan \\nVandiya Devan had heard much about Lord Pazluvoor. \\nBut, who would not have heard about them? The names of \\nthe brothers - The Elder Lord Pazluvoor and The Younger \\nLord Pazluvoor -- were renowned from Lanka in the south \\nto the Kalinga Kingdom in the north. Pazlu voor, situated \\non the northern banks of the Cauvery near the city of \\nUraiyoor was their capital. Even from the times of \\nVijayala Chozla, the Pazluvoor Family had won heroic \\nfame. They had a lot of give and take with the royal family \\nof the Chozlas. Because  of this and also because of their \\nnobility, bravery and fame the Pazluvoor clan had all the \\ndistinguishing characters of a royal family. They also had \\nthe right to carry their own pennant.The elder of the present Lords of Pazluvoor had fought in \\ntwenty-four campaigns.  During his times he had won \\nacclaim as having no equal in war in the Chozla Kingdom. \\nSince he had now crossed the age of fifty, he no longer \\nentered the battlefield directly. Nevertheless, he now held \\nseveral eminent positions in the gover nment of the \\nChozlas. In the Chozla Empire, he was the head of finance; \\nhead of food supply.  He had the authority to levy taxes \\naccording to political needs. He had the right to call upon \\nany princeling, nobleman or squire and order them thus: \\n\"This year you shall pay this much tribute\" and the powers \\nto implement such orders. Therefore, next to Emperor \\nSundara Chozla he was the most powerful man in the \\nChozla Kingdom.\\nVandiya Devan\\'s heart brimmed with an eagerness to meet \\nthis powerful, illustrious and noble Lord of Pazluvoor. At \\nthe same time he recalled the words uttered in privacy by \\nPrince Aditya Karikala, at the new Golden Palace in \\nKanchi City.\\n\"Vandiya Deva, I know you to be a brave man. At the \\nsame time I trust you to be intelligent and give you  this \\nimmense responsibility. Of the two letters I have given \\nyou, deliver one to my father the Emperor and the other to \\nmy sister the Younger Pirati. (Pirati is the term used to \\nrefer to princesses of the ruling house.) I hear all sorts of \\nrumors about even the senior officials of the kingdom in \\nTanjore.  Therefore, the contents of my letters should not \\nbecome known to anyone. Even the most eminent persons \\nshould not realize that you are carrying letters from me. Do \\nnot get into quarrels with anyone on the  way. You should \\nnot merely avoid conflicts of your seeking; but also not be \\ninvolved in disputes thrust upon you. I very well know \\nabout your courage. You have proved it several times. \\nTherefore, there shall be no loss of valor in escaping from \\nduels forced upon you. Most important, you should be \\nparticularly careful about the Lords of Pazluvoor and also \\nmy Young Uncle Madurandaka. I do not wish them to \\nknow even who you are! They should definitely not know \\nwhy you are going!\"\\nThe Crown Prince of the Choz la Empire and the \\nCommander-in-Chief of the Northern Armies, Prince \\nAditya Karikala had told him all this. The Prince had \\nrepeatedly advised Vandiya Devan about how he should \\nbehave. Since he recalled all this, Vandiya Devan \\nsuppressed his desire to meet L ord Pazluvoor. He whipped \\nhis horse to move on quickly. In spite of the prodding, his \\ntired horse merely plodded ahead. Having decided to spend \\nthe night at the Kadamboor fortress of the noble \\nSambuvaraya, he resolved to procure a better horse before \\nresuming his journey the next morning.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 2: ' Azlvar-adiyan NambiVallavarayan Vandiya Devan rode down the embankment \\nand turned his horse towards the southern path; his heart \\ndanced with joy: like those sailboats skipping across the \\nwaves. The excitement buried deep in his heart seemed to \\nerupt outward. His intuition said that he was going to meet \\nadventures experienced by none in one lifetime. \\nWhat joyous delight even as I approach the Chozla \\nKingdom! What wonders will the fert ile, bountiful land \\nbeyond Kollidam hold? How would the men and women \\nof that country behave? How many rivers? How many \\nreservoirs? How many clear streams? How wondrous \\nwould be the river Ponni (Cauvery) praised in song and \\nepic? How enchanting would be th e flower laden punnai, \\nkonnai and kadamba trees on its banks? Would not the \\nwink of the lily and the blue -lotus or the blossoming \\nwelcome of a red-lotus be a pleasant sight? How \\nmagnificent would be the spectacular temples erected by \\nthese devout Chozlas a long both banks of the Cauvery? \\nAha! Pazlayarai! Capital city of Chozlas! Pazlayarai that \\nturned Poompuhar and Uraiyoor into small country towns! \\nWhat of its  palaces, towering columns, armaments, guard \\nhouses, busy markets, Shiva temples of granite and \\ntowering Vishnu temples?\\nVandiya Devan had heard about the captivating devotional \\npoems - Thevaram & Thiru-vaaimozli - sung by music \\nexperts in those temples. He was soon to have the fortune \\nof hearing them. That was not just it -- he was soon to \\nattain favors beyond his wildest dreams. He was to \\npersonally meet Emperor Paranthaka Sundara Chozla, who \\nwas comparable to the God Velan in valor; who was as \\nhandsome as Manmatha the God of Love. Furthermore, he \\nwas soon to meet the Emperor\\'s beloved daughter, an \\nincomparable jewel among women, the Younger Pirati \\nKundavai!\\nHopefully there would be no interruptions along the way. \\nSo what if there are obstacles? I have a spear in hand, a \\nsword at my waist, armor on my chest and courage in my \\nheart.  But the orders of  the Commander-in-Chief, my \\nPrince, are strict: do not enter into any skirmish until the \\nassigned task is completed. It is pretty trying to obey that \\norder! I have followed it thus far in my travels. A mere \\ntwo-day journey remains. I must be patient until then.\\nTravelling with the intention of reaching Kadamboor Fort \\nbefore sunset, Vandiya Devan soon reached the Vaishnava \\ntemple in the town of Veera -narayana-puram. Since it was \\nthe day of the Aadi Festival, a large crowd of people had \\ngathered in the woods and glades around the temple.\\nVendors selling jack-fruit, banana, sugar-cane and various \\nother edibles had set up shops. Others sold flowers such as \\nlotus buds for worship of the Gods as well as blooms to \\ndecorate the braids of women. Mounds of tender co conuts, \\nmyrrh, candy, jaggery, betel leaves, pressed rice and \\npuffed grain were on display for sale. Fun -games and other \\namusements were in progress here and there. Astrologers, \\nexpert palm readers, soothsayers and magicians who cured poison-bites: of these there was no dearth. Amidst all this \\nVandiya Devan noticed a large gathering standing on one \\nside and he heard loud noises of argument among people \\nin its middle. An immense urge rose in him to find out \\nwhat the argument was about. He could not control i t! \\nStopping his horse by the roadside near the crowd, he \\ndismounted. Signaling the horse to wait, he parted the \\ncrowd and walked right in.\\nIt surprised him to find only three persons involved in the \\ndebate. Even though they were merely three men, the \\ncrowd around them periodically cheered their chosen \\nfavorites rather loudly. Vandiya Devan realized the cause \\nfor this  commotion and watched to find out the reason for \\nthe argument.\\nOne of the debaters seemed to be an exceptional follower \\nof the Vaishnava faith: he wore the sandal -paste namam \\nmarkings of the sect all over his body; he had styled his \\nhair into a topknot on his forehead. A short staff was in his \\nhand; his short, squat frame seemed quite strong.\\nThe other was a follower of Shiva, wearing broad ashen \\nmarks on his devout body. \\nThe third wore ocher robes and had completely shaved all \\nthe hair off his head. He was neither a Vaishnava nor a \\nSaiva: he seemed to be an Advaita philosopher beyond any \\nsect.\\nThe Saiva devotee was saying, \"Oh you Azlvar -adiyan \\nNambi! Give me an answer to this! Did not Brahma try to \\nfind Shiva\\'s head and Vishnu search for His feet? Unable \\nto see neither head nor foot did not both seek the sanctuary \\nof Lord Shiva\\'s auspicious feet? That being so, how can \\nyour Thirumal Vishnu be a greater God than Lord Shiva?\"\\nHearing this Azlvar-adiyan pounded his staff saying, \"Well \\nfella! You fanatic Saiva dust -worshiping priest! Stop your \\nnonsense. Recall that your Shiva gave boons to the ten -\\nheaded Ravana, King of Lanka. Did not all tho se boons \\nturn to sawdust when confronted by Sri Rama, an \\nincarnation of our Thirumal Vishnu? When that is so, how \\ncan your Shiva be a greater God than our Thirumal?\"\\nAt this the ocher-clad monk who believed in the One -\\nsupreme Being, intervened to say, \"Wh y do you both argue \\nwastefully? There is no end to your arguments about Shiva \\nbeing a bigger God or Vishnu being greater. Only while \\nyou are involved in these pagan rituals of devotion will \\nyou quarrel about Shiva and Vishnu. The path of \\nKnowledge is greater than devotion. Then there is the state \\nof Absolute Knowing, beyond even Knowledge. When you \\nreach that state there is no Shiva and no Vishnu. All \\nexistence is the Supreme Being. Do you know what Sri \\nSankara the Teacher says in his dissertation on the \\nscriptures ....\"\\nAt this point Azlvar-adiyan Nambi interrupted, \"Stop it \\nyou fellow! Do you know what your Sankara who wrote all those explanations for the Upanishads, the Bhagavat \\nGita and other scriptures finally say?\\nSing of Govinda, Sing of Govinda,Sing of Govinda, Oh foolish mind!\\nHe said it three times! It is to dumbheads like you that he \\nrefers when he mentions foolish minds.\"  The crowd \\nresponded to this with  thunderous clapping, mocking \\nlaughter and loud cheers of \"Aha, oho\".\\nThe monk did not stay quiet. \"Hey you with the topknot on \\nthe forehead! It is correct that you refer to me as a foolish \\nmind. You hold an ordinary wood -staff in your hands; you \\nare surely a wood-brained wastrel. It is surely because of \\nmy foolish mind that I have come to ta lk with a wastrel \\nlike you.\" \\n\"Oh Sir! This is not an ordinary wood -staff. If need be it \\nhas the power to break open your shaven head,\" and saying \\nthis Nambi raised his staff as the crowd cheered him.\\nThe Philosopher interrupted. \"Dear fellow! Stop it! K eep \\nthe staff in your own hands. I shall not be angry even if \\nyou hit me with your stick. Neither will I dispute with you. \\nThat which hits is Supreme! That which is hit is also \\nSupreme! If you lay hands upon me it is like hitting your \\nown self!\"\\nUpon hearing this Nambi announced, \"All of you watch! \\nThe Supreme is going to serve the Supreme a hallowed -hit. \\nI am going to hit myself with this staff,\" swirling his staff \\nhe moved towards the monk.\\nWatching all this, Vandiya Devan wondered if he should \\ngrab the staff from the fellow with the topknot on his \\nforehead and serve him a few smacks from it. However the \\nmonk seemed to have suddenly disappeared. He mingled \\ninto the crowd and vanished! At this the Vaishnava \\nsupporters in the crowd cheered even louder.\\nAzlvar-adiyan turned towards the Saiva devotee, \"You \\nfoot-dust worshipper, what do you say? Will you continue \\nthis debate or would you too run away like the monk?\" he \\nsaid.\\n\"Me? I shall never run away like that philosopher spouting \\nmere words. Did you think  of me also as your Kannan \\n(Krishna)? Is not your Krishna the same fellow who \\nreceived beatings from the butter -churn because he stole \\nbutter from the homes of milkmaids? ...\" Before the Shiva \\nworshipper could finish, Nambi interrupted. \\n\"Why sir? Did not your Shiva carry loads of dirt for the \\nsake of dry pudding and get beaten on his back? Have you \\nforgotten that?\" Swirling his staff he approached closer.\\nAzlvar-adiyan was a stocky, well -built brute. The Shiva \\ndevotee was an emaciated man. The cheering s upporters in the crowd were ready to enter the tussle. Vallavarayan \\nVandiya Devan felt that he must stop this absurd rumpus.\\nHe came forward and said, \"Sirs why are you arguing? Do \\nyou have nothing better to do? If you itch for a fight, why \\nnot go to Lanka? There is a big war going on there.\"\\nSaying, \"Who is this fellow trying to make peace?\" Nambi \\nquickly turned towards him. Some people in the crowd \\nliked Vandiya Devan\\'s fearless mein and charismatic face. \\n\"Thambi! You tell them.\" They cheered, \"Tell t hese \\nquarrel mongers the truth. We will support you.\" \\n\"I will tell the facts I know. There seems to be no quarrel \\nbetween Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu -Narayana. Those \\ntwo seem to be quite friendly and pleasant towards each \\nother. Then why are these two men  arguing?\"  Hearing \\nthese words of Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan the people \\nsnickered.\\nThe Shiva devotee commented \"This boy seems to be \\nintelligent. But jovial words cannot end the argument. Let \\nhim answer this question: is Lord Shiva a greater God than \\nVishnu or is he not?\"\\n\"Shiva is a great God. So is Thirumal Vishnu. Both are \\nequal. Worship whomever you want. Why quarrel?\" said \\nVallavarayan.\\n\"How can you say that? Where is the proof that Shiva and \\nVishnu are equal?\" chided Azlvar -adiyan.\\n\"Proof? I will give you proof. Last night I had been to \\nVaikunta, the abode of Vishnu. At the same time Shiva \\ncame visiting. Both were seated on equal thrones. They \\nseemed to be of equal height. Still, to avoid any doubt, I \\nmeasured their height with my arm ...\"\\n\"Young man! Are you mocking me?\" roared Azlvar -\\nadiyan. \\n\"Yes, Thambi yes. Tell us more!\" applauded the crowd.\\n\"Upon measuring them, I found both to be of exactly the \\nsame height. Without stopping at that I asked both Shiva \\nand Thirumal directly. Do you know wh at they said? `Hari \\nand Shiva are one and the same. Those who don\\'t know \\nthis should have their mouths filled with dirt!\\' Saying it \\nthey gave me this fistful of dirt to throw in the mouths of \\nthe idiots who quarrel about it.\" Vandiya Devan opened his \\nfist to show a handful of dirt. He then threw it among \\nthem. Upon this all hell broke loose. The men in the exited \\ncrowd started picking up dirt and rubble and began \\nthrowing it at each other. Azlvar -adiyan also entered the \\nfracas with shouts of \"Idiots! Unbeli evers!\" and used his \\nstaff. A great disturbance and commotion was about to \\nerupt. Luckily, a stentorian announcement thwarting all \\nthis, was heard nearby.\"Best of warriors, bravest of the brave, he who destroyed \\nthe very roots of the Pandiya army by atta cking furiously, \\nhe of the victorious spear, he who engaged in twenty -four \\ncombats and wears sixty -four battle-wounds on his sacred \\nbody, the Chozla Secretary for Finance and Food, the lord \\nwho can levy taxes, The Elder Lord of Pazluvoor, is \\nannounced. Make way! Make way!\" A thundering voice \\nmade the announcement.\\nThe heralds who made these announcements came first. \\nThen came the drummers. Behind them came men carrying \\nthe palmtree-flag. Next marched several smart footmen \\nbearing lances and spears. Behind all these men came a \\ndark, well-built man seated on a finely decorated elephant. \\nThe sight of the warrior on the elephant looked like a dark \\ncloud resting atop a mountain peak. People stood on both \\nsides of the roadway and watched. Vandiya Devan guessed \\nthat the man seated on the elephant was Lord Pazluvoor.\\nBehind the elephant came a palanquin with silken drapes \\npulled close. Before he could wonder who could be inside, \\nVallavarayan saw a fair hand full of bracelets and bangles \\ncome out and slightly part t he curtains.  The dazzling face \\nof a girl could be seen inside the palanquin: like the moon \\nshining forth from behind a shifting cloud cover.\\nThough he was a connoisseur of the beauty of womankind, \\nthough her captivating face seemed like the radiating ful l \\nmoon, for some reason, Vandiya Devan was not happy to \\nsee that face. An irrational fear and disgust took hold of \\nhim. At the same time the woman\\'s eyes focussed on \\nsomething near Vandiya Devan.  The next instant the \\nhorrified sound of a girl\\'s scream was  heard.  The screens \\npulled shut once again!\\nVallavarayan looked around him. His intuition said that the \\nlady had screamed upon sighting something nearby. He \\nsearched around again. Azlvar -adiyan was leaning back on \\na tamarind tree just behind him. He saw that the fanatic \\nVaishnava\\'s face had turned undescribably horrible and \\nugly. His heart filled with irrational surprise and revolt. \\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 3: ' Vinnagara Temple\\nSometimes trivial incidents lead to events of great \\nsignificance. One such incident now occurred to \\nVallavarayan Vandiya Devan. Remember, he was standing \\nby the roadside to watch the procession of the Pazluvoor \\nLord and his entourage? His horse stood a little away form \\nhim.\\nSome of the men walking towards the end of the Pazluvoor \\nretinue sighted the horse. \"Dear chap! Look at this mule!\" \\nsaid one of them.\"Don\\'t say mule. Say mare,\" corrected the other. \"Set the \\nsemantic research aside! First of all find out if it is a \\ndonkey or a mule!\" said a third man. \"Let\\'s check it  out!\" \\nsaid yet another as he approached the horse. He tried to \\njump on its back, but the intelligent horse realized that this \\nwas not its master; it refused to let him mount.\\n\"Hey! This is a troublesome horse. It will not let me \\nmount! Perhaps only a pri nce of well established lineage \\ncan ride it! Well then, Tanjore Muthuaraya will have to \\ncome back!\" \\nHis friends laughed at this witticism. Tanjore Muthuaraya\\'s \\ndynasty had vanished a hundred years ago! Now, a flag \\nbearing the tiger symbol of the Chozlas flew over Tanjore.\\n\"The horse may think so. However, if you ask me I would \\nsay that a fully alive Thandavaraya is better than a dead \\nMuthuaraya from Tanjore,\" said another undaunted man \\nnamed Thandavaraya.\\n\"Thandavaraya, find out if this pesky horse that  wont let \\nyou come near is really a horse! Perhaps it is a dummy \\ndance-horse come in for the temple festival,\" said another \\nprankster.\\n\"Ok, let\\'s examine it,\" saying this Thandavaraya twisted \\nthe horse\\'s tail. The proud horse kicked its hind legs \\nseveral times and began running amok. \"Hey, the mule is \\nrunning away! It really is a mare!\" shouted the man and \\nwith cries of \"Ooi, ooi,\" they began to chase the horse even \\nfurther.\\nThe horse began running helter skelter amidst the festive \\ncrowd. People trying to  avoid its hooves moved away in a \\nhurry. Even so, some of them were kicked down. The \\nhorse ran wild. All this happened within a few seconds \\nright in front of Vandiya Devan. From the expression on \\nVallavarayan\\'s face, Azlvar -adiyan, the Vaishnava, \\nsurmised it to be his horse.\\n\"Thambi, did you see the work of those Pazluvoor brutes? \\nWhat happened to the boldness that you showed in front of \\nme? Could you not show your valor against them?\" he \\npointed out.\\nVandiya Devan felt a piercing outrage. Yet, he grit hi s \\nteeth and remained patient. The Pazluvoor men were a \\nlarge group. There was no point in confronting the whole \\nlot. Neither did those men wait for him to pick a fight. \\nLaughing over their pranks with the horse they had quickly \\nmarched ahead.\\nVandiya Devan started walking in the direction in which \\nthe horse had gone. He knew that his horse would run for a \\nwhile and then stop. So he did not worry about it. He felt \\nthat one day he should settle the score with those arrogant \\nmen of Pazluvoor and the idea beca me firmly etched in his \\nmind.His horse stood in a clearing beyond the tamarind grove, \\nwearing a saddened expression. As he approached it, the \\nhorse neighed; the speechless creature seemed to say, \\n\"Why did you part from me and subject me to these \\ntravails?\" He quietened the horse by patting its back and \\nthen led it back towards the road.\\nSeveral persons of the festive crowd asked, \"Thambi why \\ndid you bring this unruly horse here? See how it has kicked \\nus?\" Others pacified them with words like \"What will t his \\nyoung man do? What could the horse have done? We have \\nto blame those Pazluvoor rogues for this mishap.\"\\nAzlvar-adiyan waited at the roadside. Vandiya Devan \\nfrowned. What nuisance is this... It seems as if this fellow \\nwill not let go.\\n\"Thambi, which way are you going?\" asked Azlvar -adiyan. \\n\"Me? I plan to go a little ways west and then a bit to the \\nsouth; then go around east to travel southwest.\"\\n\"I am not asking all that. I meant, where do you plan to \\nstay tonight?\"\\n\"Why do you ask?\"\\n\"Perhaps, if you were planning to stay at the fort of \\nKadamboor Sambuvaraya, I have an assignment to be done \\nthere ...\"\\n\"What! Do you know magic or witchcraft? How did you \\nknow that I was going to Kadamboor Palace?\" asked \\nVandiya Devan.\\n\"What is so surprising about i t? Tonight, several \\ndignitaries from various places are going there. Lord \\nPazluvoor and his retainers are also going there.\"\\n\"Is that true?\" said a surprised Vandiya Devan.\\n\"Yes, it is true. The elephant, the horses, liveried footmen \\nand other honors were from Kadamboor. They came to \\nreceive Lord Pazluvoor; all such protocols are always \\nobserved wherever he goes.\"\\nVandiya Devan became thoughtful. The opportunity to \\nstay in the same lodgings as Lord Pazluvoor was not easy \\nto come by. He may even chance to  make the acquaintance \\nof that esteemed warrior. However, the experience with the \\nunruly retainers of the Lord still rankled bitterly.\\nAzlvar-adiyan interrupted these thoughts in a begging \\nvoice, \"Thambi, will you do me a favor?\"\\n\"How can I help you? I a m new to these parts.\"\\n\"It is a task that is possible for you. Take me along to \\nKadamboor Fort tonight.\"\"Why? Is some fanatic Saiva coming there? Are you going \\nto debate about the greatness of Shiva and Thirumal to \\nconclude who is the greater God?\"\\n\"No. No. Did you think that getting into arguments was my \\nonly occupation? Tonight there will be a lavish banquet at \\nKadamboor. After the feasting there would be several \\nentertainments: music, pantomimes, miracle plays, gypsy \\ndancers and mystic oracles. I wis h to see the gypsy dance \\nand hear the oracle.\"\\n\"Even then, how can I take you along?\"\\n\"Say that I am your servant.\"\\nVandiya Devan felt that his earlier doubts were confirmed. \\n\"Find someone else for such deception and fraud. I do not \\nneed a servant like you. Anyway no one will believe it; \\nfrom what you say, I doubt if they would even let me into \\nthe fort tonight.\"\\n\"Aha! That means you are not going to Kadamboor upon \\ninvitation!\"\\n\"Well, I have an invitation of sorts. Kandamaran, the son \\nof Lord Sambuvaraya, is my close friend. He has invited \\nme several times to come and stay at his palace if I come \\nto these parts.\"\\n\"Is that all! Then even your situation is kind of doubtful \\ntonight!\"\\nBoth kept walking onwards, silently, for a while. \"Why are \\nyou still following me?\" asked Vandiya Devan.\\n\"I was about to ask you the same question. why are you \\nfollowing me? Why don\\'t you go your own way?\"\\n\"Well it is because of not knowing which way to go. \\nWhere are you going? Perhaps to Kadamboor?\"\\n\"No. You said you cann ot take me there. I am going to the \\nVinnagara temple.\"\\n\"To the presence of the deity Veera -narayana-perumal?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"I too would like to go to that temple and worship that \\nperumal.\"\\n\"I thought that you would perhaps not come to a Vishnu \\ntemple. It is a temple that should be seen; a deity worthy to \\nbehold. The priest Eshwara Munigal offers services at the \\ntemple. He is a venerable man.\"\\n\"I too have heard this. But, it is very crowded. Is there \\nsome special celebration at the temple today?\"\"Yes, today is the day of the Saint Andal. It is also the \\nAadi Festival of Padhinettam Perukku. All these festivities \\nare because of this. Thambi, have you heard any of the \\ninvocative poems of Andal?\"\\n\"I have not heard any.\"\\n\"Don\\'t. Don\\'t ever listen to her poems!\"\\n\"Why this hatred?\"\\n\"It is not hatred. Nor is it enmity. It is for your benefit that \\nI say it. If you ever happen to hear any of the melodious \\npsalms of Andal, you will drop your swords and spears; \\nlike me, you too will fall in love with Kannan and start\\nupon a pilgrimage to all the Vishnu temples.\"\\n\"Do you know any of these psalms of Andal? Can you sing \\nthem?\"\\n\"I know some. I also know some of the poems of \\nNammazlvar who translated the Vedas (scriptures) into \\nTamil. I am going to sing some of them at t he shrine. If \\nyou wish, you can listen. Here comes the temple.\"  By now \\nthey had reached the Vinnagara temple.\\nParanthaka Chozla I, a grandson of Vijayala Chozla, had \\nwon the title Conqueror of Madurai and Lanka. He was the \\nmonarch who established the fou ndations of the Chozla \\nEmpire. He achieved historical fame because he covered \\nthe roof of the temple at Chidambaram with gold. Besides \\ntitles like Jewel among Chozlas, Greatest of Warriors, he \\nalso had the honored name of Veera Narayana.\\nDuring Paranthaka\\'s times, the Rashtrakutas in the north \\nwere powerful monarchs. He expected them to come from \\nManyaketa (roughly present day Maharashtra) and invade \\nthe territories of the Tamils. Therefore he stationed a huge \\narmy, led by his eldest son Prince Raja -aditya, in the \\nThirumunaipadi Territories north of the Cauvery.\\nPrince Raja-aditya had a brilliant idea while his large \\nnumbers of soldiers waited in idleness, with nothing to do. \\nUsing them he wished to fulfil a major undertaking for the \\nbenefit of the population. Enormous quantities of flood \\nwaters flowing in the Kollidam river were going \\nwastefully into the sea. Wishing to make use of these \\nwaters, he made his soldiers build a huge, spreading \\nreservoir. In honor of his distinguished father he named it \\nthe Veera Narayana Lake. He then established the town of \\nVeera-narayana-puram on its shores and also built a \\nVinnagara temple.\\nThe Sanskrit term Vishnu Griha meaning Abode of \\nVishnu, became Vinnagara in Tamil. Does not Sri \\nNarayana, i.e., Vishnu recline upon the  primeval waters in \\nsublime meditation? Therefore, it was customary in those \\ndays to build Vinnagaras on lake shores so that the deity \\nwould protect the reservoir. Therefore, the Prince 0constructed a temple for Veera -Narayana at Veera-\\nnarayana-puram.\\nIt was to this temple that Vandiya Devan went in Azlvar -\\nadiyan\\'s company. At the sanctum sanctorium Azlvar -\\nadiyan began singing. He sang a few devotional poems by \\nAndal. He then sang a few verses of Nammazlvar:\\nPraise, praise,praise the Lord,Gone is the curse of this wretched life;\\nThere is nothing left here for Lord Yama,Who created the hells of despair and death;\\nThese creatures of the ocean -colored Lord,Reckoned on this earth, the sorrows of these times;\\nSee, they have come to worship him,Serve him with dance and song;\\nWe saw, we saw, we saw,We saw things pleasing to the eye;\\nCome, Come all ye worshippers!Come adore him, come here to salvation;\\nFollow the path of these souls dear to Lord Madhava,Live on this earth with dance and song of his glor y.\\nWhen Azlvar-adiyan sang these songs, tears overflowed \\nfrom his eyes and streamed down his cheeks. Vandiya \\nDevan listened attentively. Though tears did not stream \\nfrom his eyes, he was very moved. His biased opinions \\nabout Azlvar-adiyan were somewhat tr ansformed. This \\nfellow is very devout, he thought.\\nSeveral others listened to the songs with interest. The \\ntemple trustees came to listen. The priest Eshwara Munigal \\nheard them with tear laden eyes. The priest\\'s son, a mere \\nchild, stood nearby and listene d with rapt attention. \\nAzlvar-adiyan sang ten such poems and then stopped with \\nthese words:\\nThese be merely partsOf Thennan Gurukoor Maran Sadagopan\\'sDevotional compositionsnumbering one-thousand and twentywhich would melt any devout heart.\\nThe priest\\'s son whispered something into his fathers ears. \\nWiping his tear-laden eyes the priest came forward to ask, \\n\"Sir, it is said that Gurukoor Sadagopa known as \\nNammazlvar has sung more than thousand such poems. Do \\nyou know them all?\"\\n\"I do not have that fortune. I know just a few of his ten -\\nliners,\" replied Azlvar-adiyan Nambi.\\n\"I entreat you to teach this child all the songs you know,\" \\nrequested the priest.\\nIn later years this town was to attain several honors. The \\nboy with the childish face shining with  devotion would \\ngrow up to be known as Nadamuni Adigal the foremost of \\nVaishnava teachers. He would go to Gurukoor, the blessed town from where Nammazlvar hailed; search and collect \\nall thousand poems; set them to music; sing them and \\nalong with his disciples popularize those songs all over the \\ncountry. Alavandar who would be born as the grandson of \\nNadamuni Adigal would perform several miracles.\\nEven the great Saint Sri Ramanuja himself would come to \\nvisit this hallowed place of their birth. When he comes  he \\nwill be amazed by the Veera Narayana Lake and its \\nseventy-four irrigation-gates. He would wish to establish \\nseventy-four monastic seats to spread the holy word of \\nLord Narayana\\'s grace and benevolence to all the populace \\nin the same fashion that the re servoir distributed its \\nbountiful waters through seventy -four irrigation canals for \\nthe welfare of the people. Later seventy four such \\nmonastic-teaching-seats or pitams would be established.\\nLet us leave it to scholars to describe all these magnificent \\nhappenings of Vaishnava history and return to our hero \\nVallavarayan Vandiya Devan.\\nWhen they came outside the temple after their worship, \\nVandiya Devan said \"Sir, Mr. Nambi! I did not realize that \\nyou were such a devout and learned person. If I had \\nannoyed you with my impudence please forgive me.\"\\n\"I forgive you Thambi. Say, will you now do me a favor?\"\\n\"Did I not say that I cannot help you on your request? Did \\nyou also not agree?\"\\n\"This is something else. I will give you a small note. If you \\nstay at Kadamboor Fort, you must find an appropriate time \\nto give it to someone.\"\\n\"To whom?\"\\n\"To the lady who was in the closed palanquin behind Lord \\nPazluvoor\\'s elephant.\"\\n\"Mr. Nambi! Whom do you take me to be? Am I the \\nfellow for such activities? If anyone but yo u had uttered \\nsuch words to me ...\"\\n\"Thambi! Don\\'t be agitated. If it is not possible you can let \\nit be. Go your way. However, if you help me in this matter, \\nmy help might be useful to you at some later time. There is \\nno harm done. You can go.\"\\nAfter this Vandiya Devan did not tarry any longer. He \\njumped on his horse and sent it galloping towards \\nKadamboor.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 4: ' Kadamboor Fort1The horse had by now rested well and become quite \\nenergetic. Within a few hours it reached the g ates of \\nKadamboor. Lord Sengannan Sambuvaraya was an \\nimportant Chozla nobleman in those days. His castle gates \\nresembled the entrance of a large city -stronghold. The \\ntowering walls on both sides of the gate curved around like \\na fortress. \\nA number of elephants, horses, large bullocks as well as \\ngrooms to hold, feed and water these animals stood near \\nthe gates. Here and there men stood with flaming torches \\nto provide light; oil pourers were ready to add oil to the \\nlighted torches. Sighting all these bustlin g activities, \\nVandiya Devan felt a bit dismayed and hesitant. \\nSomething special seems to be taking place here; why have \\nI come here now ... At the same time he felt an \\noverpowering urge to find out what the special occasion \\nwas. The fortress gates were wid e open although men \\nholding long lances stood near the gates. They looked like \\nthe messengers of Yama, the Lord of Death.\\nThe dauntless youth decided that the best thing to do \\nwould be to ride boldly and go in; any hesitation on his \\npart would alert the guards to stop him. He translated his \\nthoughts into action. But what a disappointment?! As soon \\nas the horse neared the gates, lances crossed in front to \\nobstruct the way and stop him. Four men came forward \\nand held onto the horse\\'s reins. One of them peere d at \\nVandiya Devan. Another held up the flaming torch to light \\nhis face. \\nWith anger darkening his face, Vallavarayan Vandiya \\nDevan asked \"Is this customary in your town? Stopping \\nguests at your gates ...?\"\\n\"Who are you? Impudent fellow. Where do you com e \\nfrom?\"\\n\"Are you asking me my name and town? Thiruvallam in \\nthe Vanakapadi Kingdom is my town. Once upon a time, \\nsoldiers in your country were proud to tattoo the names of \\nmy ancestors on their breasts. My name is Vallavarayan \\nVandiya Devan! Do you know? \"\\n\"Why did you not bring a liveried herald to announce all \\nthis?\" said the gate-keeper. Others around him laughed.\\n\"Whoever you are, you cannot enter! All the expected \\nguests have already arrived. The Master\\'s orders are to not \\nlet in anyone after that,\"  said their leader.\\nHearing this altercation, some footmen who were standing \\nnearby came closer. \"Hey! Is this not the same mule that \\nwe chased into the festival crowd?\" said one of them.\\n\"Donkey, not mule,\" corrected another. \"Look at the \\nstarched up fellow sitting on his donkey,\" added another. \\nVallavarayan heard these words. He had been thinking, \\nwhy get involved? Perhaps I should go away quietly. Maybe I should show the token bearing the seal of Prince \\nAditya Karikala and then go in. When I have the  signet of \\nthe Prince, the Commander -in Chief of the Northern \\nArmies, none in the regions between River Pennar and \\nCape Comorin can impede my way. It was in the midst of \\nthese ponderings that he heard the mocking words of the \\nPazluvoor lackeys.  Immediatel y deciding his course of \\naction, he said \"Let go of my horse. I am going back.\"\\nThe gate-keepers let go of the reins. Vandiya Devan \\nemployed both his legs to apply a sudden pressure to the \\nunderbelly of his horse. At the same time he drew his \\nsword from its scabbard at his waist. The swirling sword \\nflashing like swift lightning in his hand appeared like God \\nVishnu\\'s spinning Chakra (discus). The horse galloped \\nforward into the fortress. The men in the way seemed to \\nsuddenly fall down. Lances and spears wer e thrown apart, \\nclanging noisily. The horse flew amidst the gossiping men \\nof Pazluvoor. The totally unexpected, lightning attack \\nscattered the men in all four directions.\\nSeveral other actions took place immediately: The fortress \\ngates banged shut thunder ingly. \"Catch him! Hold!\" shouts \\narose; spears rubbed against swords making a \"clang, \\nclang\" noise. Suddenly the drums announcing danger, \\nboomed \"dadam, dadadam\". Several men -- maybe twenty, \\nthirty, fifty or even more -- surrounded Vandiya Devan \\nand his horse. He jumped down to the ground; swirling his \\nsword in all directions he shouted \"Kandamara! \\nKandamara! Your men are killing me!\"\\nHearing his words, the men were stunned into hesitation \\nand moved away a little.\\nAt the same time a thundering voice was heard from the \\nupper balcony of the palace tower. \"What is that noise out \\nthere? Stop it!\"  Several persons were standing there, \\nlooking down on the disturbance below.\\n\"Master! Some fellow has broken our guard and entered \\nhere. He is shouting the young ma ster\\'s name,\" replied the \\ngate-keeper. \"Kandamara, go find out what the commotion \\nis about,\" said the thundering voice from the tower. \\nVandiya Devan surmised the voice to be that of Lord \\nSambuvaraya.\\nHe and the men surrounding him waited for a while. \\n\"What is all this about?\" a young voice said. The men \\nparted to make way for a youth coming hurriedly.  He \\nnoticed Vandiya Devan who stood there twirling his \\nsword, like God Muruga after killing the Demon Soora.\\n\"Vallava! Is it truly you?\" he said in an emoti onal voice \\nand ran forward to heartily embrace his friend. \\n\"Kandamara because you repeatedly insisted, I came to \\nyour house. I received this warlike welcome here,\" \\nVallavarayan pointed to the men around him.\\nKandamaran said to his men, \"You idiots! Move a side. \\nYour brains are like budding shoots on a pounding block.\" 2Kandamaran took hold of his friend\\'s hand and led him \\nhastily into the castle. His feet did not stay put on earth; \\nand his heart danced with joy. What can captivate the heart \\nof a youth more than a true friendship from his youthful \\ndays? Yes, of course there is a thing called kaadal (love). \\nBut being in love has as much sadness and pain as joy and \\npleasure. In the cheerful friendship of youth there is not \\neven a shadow of sadness. All is hear t pleasing happiness.\\n\"Kandamara, what is all this hustle and bustle about? What \\nis happening here today?\" asked Vandiya Devan.\\n\"Oh! I\\'ll explain what\\'s happening here afterwards. \\nRemember the days when you and I were at the army \\ngarrison near the Pennar  river? Remember your wishes \\n`We must meet Lord Pazluvoor, I must get the \\nacquaintance of the great Lord of Mazluvoor, I must meet \\nthat one and this one\\'? That lord, this lord, every fellow -\\nyou can meet them all here tonight,\" said Kandamaran.\\nHe then took his friend up to the upper chambers where the \\nguests were seated. He presented him to his father Lord \\nSambuvaraya and said \"Father! I have mentioned several \\ntimes about my friend Vandiya Devan of the Vaanar Clan. \\nThis is he.\"  Vandiya Devan bowed and g reeted him with \\nreverence. However, Lord Sambuvaraya did not seem too \\nhappy about it.\\n\"Is that so? Is he the fellow who created all that \\ndisturbance at the palace gates below?\" asked the father.\\n\"He was not the cause for the disturbance. It\\'s those idiot s \\nwe have for gate-keepers\" said the son.\\n\"Still, he need not have arrived in this sensational manner; \\ntoday of all days and that too hours after darkness,\" said \\nlord Sambuvaraya.\\nKandamaran frowned. He did not wish to continue the \\ndebate with his father. He led Vandiya Devan aside. He \\npresented his friend to Lord Pazluvoor, seated on a lofty \\nthrone amidst the other guests, and said \"Uncle! This is my \\ndear friend Vandiya Devan. He is from the noble Vaanar \\nclan.  He and I were on guard duty at the army bas e north \\nof the Pennar river. In those days he would often express a \\nwish to `See and meet the bravest among warriors, the \\ngreat Lord of Pazluvoor\\' and would often ask `Is it really \\ntrue that he has sixty-four war-wounds on his body?\\' I \\nwould tell him `One day you can meet him and count \\nthem\\'.\"\\n\"Is that so Thambi? Will you not believe it unless you \\npersonally count  them? Such distrust?  You suspect that \\nnone but one of the Vaanar clan can be brave?\" said Lord \\nPazluvoor.\\nBoth friends were startled. They ha d not expected the \\nnobleman to thus misconstrue their words of praise. \\nVandiya Devan felt irritated. Without showing his feelings he said \"Sir! The fame of the brave Pazluvoor clan has \\nspread from  Cape Comorin to the Himalayas. Who am I to \\ndoubt it?\" \\n\"Good reply. Intelligent fellow\" muttered Lord Pazluvoor.\\nWith a feeling of having escaped with that, the friends \\nwent out. Lord Sambuvaraya called out to his son and \\nwhispered, \"Serve your friend some food as early as \\npossible and tell him to go and sleep in some secluded \\nspot. He seems tired after a long journey!\" Kandamaran \\nshook his head angrily and walked on.\\nLater Kandamaran took his friend to the inner chambers of \\nhis mother. Several women were gathered there. Vandiya \\nDevan bowed low and greeted Kand amaran\\'s mother.  He \\nsurmised that a girl hiding shyly behind her was \\nKandamaran\\'s sister. He had imagined all sorts of things \\nbased upon Kandamaran\\'s descriptions of his younger \\nsister. In a way, he was now disappointed. His eyes \\nsearched around among tho se women, with an eagerness to \\nfind the lady who had come in the palanquin with Lord \\nPazluvoor.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 5: ' The Gypsy Dance\\nBoth friends came out from the inner chambers.  A voice \\nfrom inside called out, \"Kandamara! Kandamara!\"\\n\"My mother is calling me. Wait right here. I\\'ll be back \\ninstantly,\" said Kandamaran as he went inside once again. \\nThe voices of several women talking all at once, the sound \\nof questions being asked one upon the other and \\nKandamaran answering them with some  confusion could \\nbe heard. He also heard the women inside laughing gaily. \\nThe thought that they were perhaps laughing at him caused \\nsome shame and anger in Vandiya Devan. When \\nKandamaran came out, he took hold of his friend\\'s hand \\nand dragged him onwards s aying, \"Come let us look \\naround our palace.\" \\nHe showed him all the beautiful moonlit terraces, music \\nrooms, dance halls, storage rooms, well furnished \\nchambers, living quarters, audience halls, turrets, towers, \\nstables and other places. After a while Van diya Devan \\nasked, \"Kandamara, you made me wait outside your \\nmother\\'s chambers and went in again. At that time what \\nwas so special to provoke the laughter and joy inside? \\nWere the women so happy to see me, your friend?\"\\n\"They were all very happy to meet yo u. In fact my mother \\nand others liked you a lot. But they were not laughing \\nabout you ...\"\\n\"Then why the laughter?\"3\"You know the Lord of Pazluvoor? At this age, after all \\nthese years he has recently married a very young girl. He \\nhas brought her here in a covered palanquin. Apparently he \\nhas kept her locked up in his own chambers without \\nsending her to the inner apartments in the palace. One of \\nthe maids who saw the girl by peeping in through the \\nwindow, came and described her beauty. That is the cause \\nfor the laughter.  They were discussing if she was a \\nSinghala girl, a Kalinga lady or perhaps a maid from \\nChera. You know that the ancestors of the Pazluvoor clan \\noriginally came here from the Chera country?\"\\n\"I have heard it too. Perhaps you had told me ea rlier. \\nThat\\'s OK! Kandamara, how long is it since Lord \\nPazluvoor married this mysterious beauty?\"\\n\"It must be less than two years. He has not left her alone \\nfor even a short while from the time he married her! He \\ntakes his ladylove along wherever he goes;  in a closed \\npalanquin! In fact there has been a lot of sniggering about \\nit all over the country. Vandiya Deva, won\\'t there be \\nridicule and derision if men who are past a certain age get \\ninvolved in such entanglements with women?\"\\n\"I do not think that is the reason. Kandamara, shall I tell \\nyou the real reason for the laughter? Generally women are \\nenvious. Don\\'t think I am belittling the women in your \\nfamily. All womankind is like that! The women of your \\nhousehold are dark-colored beauties. However, Lord \\nPazluvoor\\'s beloved is rosily -fair and golden hued. That is \\nwhy these women do not like her; they are making up \\nstories about her...!\"\\n\"Hey! What is this wonder? How do you know about her \\ncomplexion? Why, have you seen her? Where? How did \\nyou see her? If Lord Pazluvoor knows of this, your life is \\nnot yours!\"\\n\"Kandamara, I am not afraid of all that. You know it. \\nMoreover, I have not done anything improper. I was \\nwatching, one among the crowd on the roadside, when \\nLord Pazluvoor and his retinue went past. The  elephant, \\nhorses, livery, footmen, drummers -- I believe all these \\nwere honors sent by your family to receive him. Is that \\ntrue?\"\\n\"Yes we had sent all those accolades. So what ...?\"\\n\"So what? Nothing. I was just comparing the reception that \\nyou accorded to Lord Pazluvoor and the welcome given to \\nme; nothing else ...\"\\nKandamaran laughed lightly, \"We gave him the tribute and \\nhonor due to the official who levies taxes. A welcome \\nappropriate to a great warrior was given to you! Sometime, \\nwith God Muruga\\'s grace, when you become the son -in-\\nlaw to our house we shall give you the honors due to a \\nbridegroom and welcome you.\" He then added, \"But, you were about to say something \\nelse; we were sidetracked. Oh yes! You were saying that \\nLord Pazluvoor\\'s beloved was  very fair and light in color. \\nHow did you know that?\"\\n\"Lord Pazluvoor was coming seated on the dark, huge \\nelephant from Kadamboor Fort: like Yama, the God of \\nJustice seated upon a huge water -buffalo! All my thoughts \\nwere concentrated on him. While I was building dream-\\nempires about one day becoming famous and powerful like \\nhim, a covered palanquin followed him. Even as I \\nwondered about who could come in a covered palanquin, a \\nhand from inside parted the curtains. I could barely see the \\nface within. The hand and face were golden -hued. That \\nwas all I saw. From what you said just now, I realize that \\nshe must be the beloved of Lord Pazluvoor.\"\\n\"Vandiya Deva, you are a lucky fellow! It is being said \\nthat no man has glimpsed upon that Young -Queen of \\nPazluvoor. You could at least see her hand and face for a \\nsecond. From what you saw, can you guess anything about \\nthe nation which gave birth to that beauty?\" asked \\nKandamaran.\\n\"I did not ponder about it at that time. Now that I think of \\nit, she is perhaps a woman f rom the Kashmir country; or \\nshe is a beauty who hails from the distant lands across the \\nsea like Java, Kadaram (Malaya), Yavana (Greece -Rome). \\nMaybe she is a princess from Arabia: I believe that women \\nin that country are hidden behind veils from birth till\\ndeath.\"\\nAt that moment, the sound of musical instruments could be \\nheard somewhere nearby. Several kinds of drums, flutes, \\npipes and instruments like salli, karadi, parai, udukku  \\nwere being tuned together. \"What is that noise?\" asked \\nVallavarayan.\\n\"The Kuravai Koothu (gypsy dance) is about to begin. The \\ndrums and flutes are being tuned in preparation. Would \\nyou like to watch the gypsy dance? Or, would you like to \\neat early and sleep well?\" \\nVandiya Devan recalled Azlvar -adiyan mentioning the \\ngypsy dance. \"I have never seen the gypsy dance; I must \\nsurely see it,\" he said.\\nWhen they walked ahead a little and turned, they could see \\nthe stage being set for the dancers. The guests were \\ngathering in front of the stage. The stage for the gypsy \\ndance was set in a wide courtyard spread with clean -white \\nsand and situated in a spot surrounded by the palace walls \\nand the towering battlements of the fort. The stage was \\ndecorated with colorful drawings of cocks, peacocks, \\nswans and parrots. They had further decked the  stage with \\nseveral fragrant flower garlands, red -rice popped white, \\ncolored millet, yellow turmeric and other powders, \\nkunrimani (small red berry -beads), and other vivid \\ndecorations.  Tall oil-lamps and flaming torches tried to \\ndrive the darkness away. Bu t the swirling fragrance from 4smoldering frankincense and smokey torches created a \\nmisty screen dimming the lights.  The musicians sat on \\nboth sides and in front of the stage and played their \\ninstruments with gusto. The fragrant flowers, sweet \\nsmelling incense and the drum beats all together made \\nVandiya Devan feel light -headed.\\nAfter all the important guests were seated, the nine \\nmaidens who were to perform the gypsy dance came on \\nthe stage. They wore the tight fitting clothes and \\nornaments suitable for d ancing; they had bell-filled anklets \\non their feet; brilliant red hued flowers of the hill country, \\nflowers favored by the God Muruga, decorated their \\nhairstyles. A long garland woven with such flowers thrown \\nupon their shoulders, seemed to bind them to ea ch other as \\nthey stood upon the stage. In their hands they daintily \\ngrasped beautiful parrots made of sandalwood painted a \\nvivid green.\\nAfter greeting the audience they began to sing and dance. \\nThey first sang a few verses in praise of God Muruga. \\nThey sang of the brave deeds of Muruga; and they sang of \\nhis victorious spear which killed the demons Soora -padma \\nand Gaja-mukha and then dried up the vast ocean. They \\nsang of how he chose for his bride, a maid from the Tamil \\ncountry, a gypsy maid from the hills who was guarding the \\nmillet fields, even as heavenly nymphs offered prayers to \\nmarry the young warrior -God. Their song celebrated the \\ngrace and benevolence of Velan, i.e., Murugan who bears \\nthe spear. The lyrical songs, the fast paced dance, the quick \\ndrum-beats, enchanting flute all in combination bewitched \\nthose who were watching. With the following words of \\nprayer the dance concluded:\\nLet hunger and disease be destroyed;Let enmity be routed;Let rain and fertility increase;Let bounty grow boundless.\\nThe maidens stepped off the stage and moved away.\\nNext, a man and woman dressed as oracles -- thevar-aalan \\nand thevar-aati,  came on stage. The divine -man and \\ndivine-woman wore blood-red clothes. They had brilliant \\ngarlands made of blood -red oleander flowers. They had \\npainted their foreheads with bright red kumkum powders. \\nEven their lips seemed blood -red because they had chewed \\nthe betel leaf and areca -nut. Their eyes seemed blood -shot! \\nThe Velan Attam or oracle dance, began calmly enough. \\nThey danced by themselves and with arms linked together. \\nAs time passed the tempo and passion increased. The \\ndivine-woman picked up a spear from the side. The man \\ntried to pry it from her hands; and she would not let go. \\nThe dance became more frenzied: finally the man leaped \\nacross the resonating stage, jumping high, he plucked the \\nspear from his companion. With an expression of fear on \\nher face she moved away behind the screens.\\nThe divine-man now danced all by himself with more and \\nmore rapid movements. He acted the part of the God Velan killing the demon Soora. Soora\\'s head was chopped off \\nrepeatedly. But the severed -head grew back again and \\nagain. Velan grew angrier and angrier as the head came \\nback again and again. Sparks flew from his eyes. In the \\nend Soora fell dead. Thevar-aalan threw his spear down.\\nBy now all musical instruments were quiet. Only the little \\nhand-held drum, the udukku could be heard. A priest stood \\nnear the stage fanatically beating the hand -drum. Each part \\nof Thevar-aalan\\'s body shuddered. Thos e in the audience \\nwhispered to each other: \"The spirit has materialized.\" \\nSoon the priest looked at the frenzied Thevar -aalan and \\nsaid, \"Vela! Muruga! Commander of the Gods! Lord who \\nkilled Soora! Please reveal your divine predictions to us, \\nyour devotees.\"\\n\"Ask fellow! Ask whatever you want! I will reveal all!\" \\nreplied the delirious man. \"Will the rains be good? Shall \\nwe have plenty of water? Will the land be bountiful? Will \\nour desires be fulfilled?\" asked the priest.\\n\"The rains will be in season. The  waters would be \\nabundant. The land will be fruitful and desires will be \\nfulfilled! But you have not made offerings to my Mother! \\nThe Goddess desires a sacrifice. The Mother -Goddess \\nwants a sacrifice!\" shouted the dancer in delirium.\\n\"What sacrifice?\" asked the priest.\\n\"Will it be offered if I ask?\"\\n\"Yes, we will offer it. We shall surely offer the sacrifice.\"\\n\"She wants the blood of royalty! She thirsts for the blood \\nof a prince from a thousand year -old dynasty!\" shouted the \\nfrenzied dancer in a horrib le voice. \\nThe dignitaries seated in front of the stage -- Lord \\nPazluvoor, Lord of Mazluvoor, Lord Sambuvaraya and \\nothers, they looked at each other. Their eyes seemed to talk \\na secret language. Lord Sambuvaraya seemed to make a \\nsign to the priest.\\nThe priest stopped beating his hand -drum. The dancer \\ndropped upon the stage like a felled tree. The woman \\ndancer ran in to help him out. The audience dispersed \\nsilently. Somewhere outside, the howling of wolves could \\nbe heard.\\nVandiya Devan, who had been watch ing all this with some \\nagitation, looked towards the direction in which the \\nhowling wolves were heard. There, atop the outer ramparts \\nof the fortress, he saw a head! \\nIt was Azlvar-adiyan\\'s head. For a second he was subject \\nto a horrifying feeling. It app eared as if the severed head of \\nAzlvar-adiyan had been placed upon those walls. He \\nblinked his eyelids to look again: the head was no longer \\nthere! He felt ashamed about the worthless fear that had 5taken hold of him. Several other emotions beyond his \\nexperience seemed to agitate his thoughts.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 6: ' Midnight Meeting\\nAfter the gypsy dance and the oracle dance, there was a \\nlavish feast for the guests. Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan \\ncould not enjoy the banquet. His body was tired an d his \\nmind was agitated. His friend Kandamaran, seated next to \\nhim, pointed out the several dignitaries with pride.\\nBesides Lord Pazluvoor and Lord Sambuvaraya, there was \\nThennavan Mazlava-raya Lord of Mazlapadi Mazluvoor; \\nThe Elder and largest land -holder of Kunratoor had come; \\nthen there was triple-crowned Pallava-raya. The Lords \\nThanthongi Kalinga-raya, Vanangamudi Munai -raya, \\nDeva-senapati Poova-raya; that fearless lion, Lord Muthu -\\nraya, double-canopied Raajali, and the chief land -holder of \\nKolli Hills-- all these men were there at the banquet. \\nKandamaran whispered their names into Vandiya Devan\\'s \\nears and pointed them out discretely.\\nThese dignitaries were not ordinary men; nor was it \\ncommon to see them all assembled together in one place \\nlike this. Each of them was a territorial chieftain; or they \\nhad earned the distinction of territorial chieftains because \\nof their bravery. In those days, the title araya or raya which \\nwas derived from the sanskrit word raja or Tamil word \\narasa (meaning king) denoted  nobility or royalty. \\nTerritorial chieftains and noblemen of equal rank were \\nentitled to add the suffix rayan or arayan to their names. \\nThey were also called by the name of their town with the \\nadded title. (In fact our hero Vandiya Devan bore the name \\nVallava-rayan because he was born in the noble family of \\nVallam.)\\nBut, these chieftains did not bear their titles merely \\nbecause of their noble birth and thereby enjoy the comforts \\nand indulgence of palace life. Only those men who were \\nable-bodied and brave enough to enter the battle -field \\ncould safeguard their titles and territories. Therefore, each \\nof these men had not only participated in several \\ncampaigns but they also bore the wounds of such warfare \\non their bodies. Now, all these men governed their \\nterritories or kingdoms under the suzerainty of Emperor \\nSundara Chozla of Pazlayarai. Many of them were \\nimportant officials of the Chozla government.\\nNormally, Vandiya Devan would have felt immense \\nelation at having seen all these noblemen in the same \\nplace. However, he felt no joy about it. Why have all these \\nmen gathered together here? The question occurred to him \\nagain and again. All sorts of garbled doubts filled his \\nmind. With his mind filled with such confusion, he sought his \\nbed in the isolated spot re adied by Kandamaran for him. \\nBecause the palace was hosting several important \\ndignitaries, a tiny, covered terrace was allotted to him as a \\nbed-chamber. \\n\"You seem to be very tired. Lie down and sleep well. I will \\ntake care of the other guests and later c ome to sleep in this \\nterrace itself,\" said Kandamaran before going away.\\nAs soon as he lay down, sleep swirled into Vandiya \\nDevan\\'s eyes. Nitra Devi, the Goddess of Sleep took hold \\nof him completely. But what use? There is Mind which \\ncannot be conquered even by the Goddess of Sleep! Even \\nthough his body remained still and his eyes stayed tightly \\nshut, thoughts buried deep in the mind blossomed into \\ndreams. Several meaningless incidents, happenings beyond \\nreason took place in that dream world. \\nSomewhere in the distance a lone wolf howled. One wolf \\nbecame ten wolves; hundred wolves; they all howled \\ntogether. While howling they came nearer and nearer and \\nnearer. In that pitch darkness their eyes burned like tiny \\nembers. They came closer and closer. Vandiya D evan tried \\nto turn around and run away to escape. But, on the other \\nside there were tens, hundreds, no thousands of dogs --\\nbarking loudly, rushing towards him. The eyes of those \\nhunting dogs glowed like embers. What will happen to me \\nif I am caught in between these mad dogs and wolves? \\nthought Vandiya Devan and shivered. \\nLuckily there was a temple right in front. He ran into the \\ntemple and pulled the door shut, bolting it hurriedly. When \\nhe looked around it seemed to be a temple of the Mother \\nGoddess. A statue of Kali stood there with a horrible face \\nand tongue hanging out.  A priest rose from behind the \\nstatue. He held a terrible machete in his hands. \"Oh! You \\nhave come,\" he said as he came closer and closer.\\n\"What is the history of your noble family? F or how many \\ngenerations have your clansmen ruled their kingdom? Tell \\nthe truth!\" said the priest.\\n\"The Vallava Rayas of the Vaanar family had ruled for \\nthree hundred years. During my father\\'s times we lost all \\nour lands to the Vaithumba kings,\" replied Va ndiya Devan. \\n\"Then you are not the right sacrifice. Run away,\" said the \\npriest with disgust. \\nSuddenly Kali turned into a statue of Krishna! Two \\ndelightful maidens came in, singing the psalms of Saint \\nAndal and danced with abandon in front of the statue. \\nWhile he was enchanted with these sights, he heard the \\nsong \"We saw, we saw, we saw things pleasing to the eye,\" \\nbehind him. Turning around he saw Azlvar -adiyan Nambi. \\nYes it was him singing. Oh no. Not him; it was just his \\nhead that sang. The severed head  was placed on the \\nsacrificial alter! 6Unable to bear this sight, Vandiya Devan turned away. \\nUpon turning, he banged his head upon the pillar. The \\ndream melted away. Eyes opened. But he saw a sight that \\nseemed to mix reality with dreams.\\nIn a spot directly in front of his terrace, he could see the \\nfortress walls of Kadamboor palace; he could see a head \\non top of these walls. It was the head of that very same \\nAzlvar-adiyan Nambi. This time he realized that it was \\nneither a dream nor a hallucination. Becaus e, however \\nlong he stared at it, the head remained there. It was not \\nmerely a head, there was a body behind it. He could easily \\ndetect both hands of Azlvar -adiyan holding on to the wall. \\nIn addition, the fellow was staring rather intensely at \\nsomething below, inside the wall. \\nWhat is he looking at so earnestly, inside there? ... There is \\nsome kind of deception and intrigue in this. Azlvar -adiyan \\ncould not have come here with good intentions. He must \\nhave come here with vile plans to perform some evil deed . \\nIs it not my duty, being Kandamaran\\'s dearest friend, to \\nstop this wickedness? How can I sleep in idleness without \\nguarding the house of these folks who have fed and housed \\nme tonight? Vallavarayan jumped up. He picked up a knife \\nin its sheath lying on h is side and stuck it in his waist -\\nband. He walked towards the direction in which he saw \\nNambi\\'s head.\\nRemember, he was sleeping in a corner of the upper \\nterrace? From there as he walked towards the outer walls \\nof the palace, he had to go around several tu rrets, pillars \\nand decorative rooftops. After walking on for a while he \\nsuddenly heard the sound of voices talking somewhere \\nnearby. He hesitated. Hiding himself behind a pillar he \\npeeped down below. \\nIn a narrow courtyard enclosed by tall walls he saw ab out \\nten or twelve men seated comfortably. The towering walls \\nhid the rising moonlight. However, an iron oil -lamp buried \\nin the wall gave some light. All the men seated there were \\nthe dignitaries he had met at the banquet earlier; the \\nchieftains and elder officials of the Chozla Empire. \\nThey must have gathered in this midnight conference to \\ndiscuss some important matter. Azlvar -adiyan must be \\ntrying to spy upon what they were saying and doing, by \\nhanging on the outer walls. There is no doubt about the \\nfact that Azlvar-adiyan is a very shrewd and clever fellow. \\nFrom where he was positioned on the wall, Azlvar -adiyan \\ncould more or less see all the men seated in conference \\nbelow. He could hear their talk very well. But the men \\nseated there  could not see Azlva r-adiyan. The courtyard \\nand palace wall were situated in that fashion! Somehow, \\nthe fellow had chanced upon such a perfect spot. \\nCapable fellow. No doubt!  But all his cleverness will not \\nwork with this Vandiya Devan of the Vaanar clan. \\nSomehow, I must get hold of that masquerading Vaishnava \\nfanatic .... but if I am to catch him, I cannot do so without \\nattracting the attention of the men assembled below. I have to cross the courtyard before I can reach those walls. There \\nmay be some danger in crossing the  courtyard in full view \\nof those men.\\nHe recalled the words of Sambuvaraya saying \"He need \\nnot have come here, today of all days.\" \\nThese men are gathered here to discuss something \\nimportant. It is clear that they do not want anyone to know \\nwhat their discussions are about. In such a situation if they \\nsuddenly see me, they will start suspecting me. By the time \\nI explain about Azlvar-adiyan he would have jumped off \\nthe wall and escaped. All that will remain is the doubt \\nabout me. If they ask, \"Why did you,  who were supposed \\nto be sleeping, come here?\" what can I reply? I will \\ndefinitely put Kandamaran in a delicate position. There! \\nEven Kandamaran is part of this meeting; he is seated at \\nthe back. If I ask him in the morning I can know all.\\nAs these thoughts ran through his mind, Vandiya Devan \\nsaw a covered palanquin resting in one corner of the \\ncourtyard below him. Is this not the same palanquin that \\ncame behind Lord Pazluvoor and his elephant?  That lady \\nwho was in it, who parted the curtains to peep outs ide, I \\nwonder where she is now. I believe the old man did not \\neven send her to the women\\'s apartments. This is the \\npredicament if somewhat older men marry very young \\ngirls. Suspicion drains their very life. They cannot bear to \\nbe parted from their young wi ves even for one moment! \\nPerhaps even now, Pazluvoor\\'s Young -Queen is in this \\npalanquin! Gosh! Look at the fate of this great warrior! At \\nthis age, he is enslaved by a slip of a girl and is on tender -\\nhooks. She is not all that great a Rathi, Menaka or Ramb a \\n(heavenly beauties). \\nNo, Vandiya Devan had not forgotten the feeling of \\ndistaste which he experienced when he had seen her by the \\nroadside. I wonder what this brave Lord Pazluvoor sees in \\nher?  More surprising is this Azlvar -adiyan\\'s madness. \\nMaybe he is waiting on that wall because this palanquin is \\nhere. What is the relationship between him and her? How \\ncan I know?  Perhaps she is his sister; or maybe his \\nsweetheart. Maybe Lord Pazluvoor forcefully abducted \\nher. He is capable of doing such things. May be this fellow \\nis wandering around trying to find an opportunity to meet \\nher and talk to her. Why should I bother about all this. Let \\nme go back to sleep, thought Vandiya Devan.\\nJust as he made this decision he heard his name being \\nuttered down below. Imm ediately he began to listen with \\nsome interest.\\n\"That fellow who came in saying that he was a friend of \\nyour son? Where is he sleeping? He should not hear \\nanything that we utter here. Remember that he serves the \\nCommander-in-Chief of the Northern Armies. Till all our \\nplans are complete and the time for action arrives, no one \\nshould know about our plans. Even if there is the slightest \\nsuspicion that this fellow knows something, he must not be 7let outside this fortress. In fact it would be better to put a \\ncomplete end to his activities ...\"\\nOur readers can guess how Vandiya Devan felt upon \\nhearing these words. But he did not move away from the \\nspot. He made up his mind to listen to all their talk.\\nWho was the Northern Commander -in-Chief? It was none \\nother than the eldest son of Emperor Sundara Chozla. \\nNone other than the Crown Prince, next in line for the \\nthrone. Why should these fellows object to my serving that \\nPrince? What is it that they are planning that must be kept \\nsecret from the Prince?\\'\\nAt that moment Kandamaran intervened for his friend: \\n\"Vandiya Devan is sleeping peacefully in the corner \\nterrace. He cannot hear the discussions in this meeting. He \\nwill not interfere in things that do not concern him. Even if \\nhe hears something he will not hinder y our plans in any \\nway. I will be responsible for that.\"\\n\"I am happy that you trust him so much. But none of us \\nknow of him or his credentials. That is why I warned you. \\nWhat we are going to discuss now is about the rights of \\nsuccession to a large empire. E ven if one whisper gets out \\nbecause of carelessness it may lead to severe \\nconsequences. All of you must remember this,\" said Lord \\nPazluvoor.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 7: ' Laughter And Hatred\\nVandiya Devan made up his mind as soon as he heard the \\nwords `Right to the empire\\' uttered by Lord Pazluvoor. \\nWhat are these men going to say about the rights to \\nsuccession? Who are they to discuss it? I must definitely \\nfind out what is happening here. I better sit right here; \\nthere cannot be a more convenient h iding spot. Let the \\nNambi go do what he wants. Why should I bother about \\nhim?\\nVandiya Devan had surmised earlier that something \\nmysterious was taking place in that palace.  The cryptic \\nwords of Azlvar-adiyan, the arrogant behavior of the gate -\\nkeepers, the frightening words of the frenzied soothsayer --\\nall these had raised several doubts. Here was an \\nopportunity to clear all those apprehensions! Why not \\nutilize the heaven sent chance?\\nWell! Even Kandamaran, who I considered a dear friend, \\nhas not told the truth. He sent me to bed and has come to \\nthis secret midnight-meeting. I must not let him off easily \\ntomorrow!\\nBy now, Lord Pazluvoor had started talking. Vandiya \\nDevan listened carefully. \"I am here to announce a very \\ngrave news to you all. That is why Sambuvaraya has convened this meeting. Right now, the health of Emperor \\nSundara Chozla, is cause for great concern. I have secretly \\nasked the palace Doctors: they have said `There is not \\nmuch hope now. He is not likely to live much longer.\\'  \\nTherefore, we have to decide upon the next course of \\naction.\"  So said Lord Pazluvoor.\\n\"What have the astrologers said?\" asked one of the men.\\nAnother replied \"Why ask the astrologers? Hasn\\'t the long -\\ntailed comet been appearing in the evening skies for \\nseveral days? Is that not enough?\"\\nLord Pazluvoor replied to this: \"We have consulted the \\nastrologers also. They postpone the time a little. That is all. \\nAnyway, we have to now think about who is eligible to \\nsucceed to the throne ...\"\\n\"What is left to think about now?   Was not Aditya \\nKarikala coronated as the Crown Prince two years ago \\nitself?\" declared a hoarse voice.\\n\"True. But I would like to know if any one of us was \\nconsulted before the coronation took place. Each one of us \\ngathered here belongs to well establish ed clans that have \\nstrived for more than a hundred years, for more than four \\ngenerations, to acquire the eminence of this Chozla \\nEmpire. My great-grandfather died in the battle of Thiru -\\npuram-biyam. My grandfather lost his life during the war \\nin Vellur. My father sacrificed his life at Takkolam. In a \\nsimilar fashion, ancestors to each of you have given their \\nlives to establish the greatness of this Chozla Empire. \\nYoung men from our families have died in the battlefield. \\nEven today, sons from our family and clan are engaged in \\nwarfare in Lanka.  But the Emperor did not consult our \\nopinion for the decision about a successor to the throne. \\nEven Emperor Dasaratha of the Epic convened an \\nassembly of his advisors before deciding to crown Lord \\nRama as the Crown Pri nce; he consulted his ministers, \\nadvisors, army commanders  and chieftains under him.  \\nBut, our Sundara Chozla did not consider it necessary to \\nconsult anyone  ...\"\\n\"It is correct to say that he did not consult any of us. \\nHowever, it is not accurate when the Lord of Taxes says \\nthat the emperor did not consult anyone! The opinions of \\nthe Elder Pirati Sembiyan Madevi and that of the Younger \\nPirati Kundavai Devi were asked for. Can Lord Pazluvoor \\ndeny this?\"  When a member asked this in a mocking \\nvoice, some others of the group laughed.\\n\"Well! You all laugh! I do not know how you can think of \\nlaughter. My very heart burns when I think of it; my blood \\nboils. I wonder why I should safeguard my life and live \\nwithout any sense of shame. The soothsayer who danced in \\nfrenzy said that the Goddess is asking for a sacrifice. He \\nasked for a human sacrifice; of a prince from a thousand -\\nyear old dynasty. Give me up as the sacrifice. My family is \\nmore ancient than a thousand years. With a blow across \\nmy throat, each of you with your swords offer me as the 8sacrifice. The Mother Goddess will be satisfied; my soul \\nwill be satisfied.\"\\nLord Pazluvoor spoke the above words with as much rage \\nas the frenzied soothsaying -dancer.\\nSilence prevailed for a short while. The whistling o f the \\nwestern breeze and the whispering of the trees near the \\nwall were the only sounds.\\n\"I beg for the patience and forgiveness of the Pazluvoor \\nKing for having uttered some words in ignorance and the \\nthoughtless laughter that followed. You are our leade r \\nwithout any equal. We here, are all ready to carry out any \\nof your commands. We will walk in the path you direct us. \\nPlease grant forgiveness,\" spoke an emotional \\nSambuvaraya.\\n\"I too lost my composure. You should forgive me. Think \\nof one thing. Two hund red years before today, Vijayala \\nChozla broke the power of the Muthuaraya kings and \\ncaptured Tanjore. During the battle of Thiru -puram-biyam, \\nhe helped the Pallava army and destroyed the legions of \\nMadurai Pandiya. From that moment, the Chozla Kingdom \\nhas been growing and expanding day -by-day. The Chozla\\'s \\nhad not acquired this greatness even during the times of \\nhistoric Karikala Valava who built the embankments for \\nthe Cauvery.  Today, the empire spreads from Cape \\nComorin in the south to the Thungabadra -Krishna rivers in \\nthe north. The Pandiya Kingdom, Nanjil Kingdom, the \\nChera Kingdom which has not been subjugated by anyone \\nso far, Thondai Territories, Paagi, Gangapadi, Nulampadi, \\nVaithumba Territories, the Chitpuli nation, Bana lands, \\nKudagu Hill Territories where river Ponni rises, -- all these \\nlands are now under Chozla control and are paying tribute. \\nThe Chozla tiger-flag flies in all these countries. By now, \\neven Lanka in the south as well as Vengi and Rashtrakuta \\nin the north should have come under ou r sway. I do not \\nhave to give you the reasons for them not being \\nvanquished; you know the reasons ....\"\\nLord Mazluvoor intervened: \"Yes. All of us know the \\nreason. There are two reasons for Lanka, Vengi, Kalinga \\nand Rashtrakuta not coming under our suzera inty. One \\ncause is the Northern Commander -in-Chief, Prince Aditya \\nKarikala; the other is the Commander of the Southern \\nArmies, Arulmozli Varma.\"\\n\"I agree with the reasons given by Lord Mazluvoor. For \\nthe last hundred years the practice for appointing a \\ncommander in the Chozla Kingdom was different. Brave \\nwarriors, with the experience of several campaigns would \\nbe selected as Generals of the army and as Commanders -\\nin-Chief. But what has happened today? The elder Prince \\nis a commander for the northern armies . What is he doing? \\nHe is not planning campaigns against the twin territories of \\nthe Rashtrakutas or against Vengi (modern Eluru of \\nAndhra) in the northeast. He sits in Kanchi, building a \\nGolden Palace! I ask you, the bravest warriors born in the \\nbest of clans: till now, has any king in the Tamil Nation built a Golden Palace for his own dwelling?  Even the \\nmost famous Emperor Paranthaka, who conquered \\nMadurai and Lanka and is now in his heavenly abode, did \\nnot build himself a Golden Palace. He merely covere d the \\nroof of the temple in Chidambaram with gold. But Prince \\nAditya Karikala builds himself a Golden Palace in Kanchi, \\nfor his residence!  Apparently, the huge palaces from \\nwhich great Pallava monarchs ruled their empires for \\nseveral generations, are not adequate for the prestige of our \\nPrince! He builds a Golden Palace!  He embeds rubies and \\ndiamonds in the walls of that palace. Not a copper coin \\nfrom all the treasures captured from our campaigns in the \\nGangapadi, Nulampadi and Kudagu Territories has he s ent \\nback to the treasury in the capital till now.\"\\n\"Has the construction of this Golden Palace been \\ncompleted?\"\\n\"Yes. My spies tell me that it has been completed. In \\naddition letters arrived for the Emperor from his beloved \\nelder son! He wants the Empero r to come and stay for a \\nwhile, in that newly constructed Golden Palace.\"\\n\"Is the Emperor going to Kanchi?\" asked another alarmed \\nvoice.\\n\"You need not have any concern about that. I am there to \\ntake care that nothing like that will take place; my brother , \\nthe Commander of Tanjore is also there. None can enter \\nthe fort of Tanjore without the consent of the Younger \\nLord Pazluvoor. None can interview the Emperor without \\nmy knowledge; nor can they give letters. Twice or maybe \\nthrice, I have stopped letters th at arrived for him.\"\\n\"Long life to Lord Pazluvoor! Hail the Chanakian political \\nastuteness of the Pazluvoor king! Long life to his bravery!\" \\nsuch shouts arose.\\n\"Please listen a little longer! Much more than the deeds of \\nthe Crown Prince, the activities o f Prince Arulmozli \\nVarma who has gone to Lanka are peculiar. What do we \\nknow of the rules of warfare? For generations and over \\nseveral hundreds of years, what policy have our ancestors \\nfollowed? If our armies invade enemy territories, the food \\nsupplies and payments for our armies have to be procured \\nfrom those enemy lands. The wealth to pay our army must \\nbe captured in those enemy regions. Excess treasures \\nshould be sent back to the government treasury in the \\ncapital city ... But, do you know what Prince Ar ulmozli is \\ndoing?  He wants food supplies to be sent from here, by \\nships, to feed our soldiers in Lanka! For the last one year, \\nten times, I have sent such shiploads of supplies.\" \\n\"Most unusual and peculiar! We cannot tolerate such \\nillegalities! Never heard of such behavior!\" rose several \\nvoices.\\n\"Listen to the reasoning of Prince Arulmozli for this \\npeculiar behavior. If we try to procure supplies for our \\narmies from the territories we invade, we would cause a lot 9of inconvenience to the civilians and ga in the displeasure \\nof the farmers in that land. Our dispute is with the royalty \\nof Lanka; not with Lankan populace. Therefore we should \\nnot harass them in any way. After winning our battles \\nagainst their royalty, we should rule with the full approval \\nof those people. Therefore, the food and monies must be \\nsent from the homeland.\" \\nSomeone from the meeting intervened by saying, \"We \\nshould not demand anything from the nations we have \\nconquered! We should fall at their feet and worship their \\npeople! I have never heard of such conduct in warfare.\" \\n\"Ask me about the consequences of such activities! \\nBecause of these undertakings of both the Princes, the \\ntreasury and granary in the royal palace at Tanjore often \\nbecome empty! I am compelled to levy more taxes on you \\nand also collect tributes from all of you. Perhaps that is \\nwhy the Chozlas have appointed me as their Tax Official. \\nIf I had not considered the welfare of this country as most \\nimportant, I would have given up my positions long ago!\"\\n\"Oh no! Never! Your holding these positions gives us \\nseveral assurances. Why have you not spoken about these \\nthings to the Emperor?\"\\n\"Why not? I have personally spoken to him about it several \\ntimes. Every time I am put aside with words like, `Ask the \\nElder Pirati. Ask the Younger Pirati.\\' Remember I told you \\nearlier, the Emperor has lost the capability of thinking for \\nhimself. Neither does he ask our opinion on important \\nmatters. The words of his elder aunt, the Elder Pirati \\nSembiyan Madevi, are gospel to him; after that he  wants \\nme to consult with his beloved daughter the Younger Pirati \\nKundavai. I, who have grown grey in the service of this \\nnation, I, along with other ministers, have to go and stand \\nin the presence of that slip of a girl -- a girl who has not \\ncrossed the River Kollidam in the north or River \\nKudamuruti in the south -- and then consult her opinion. \\nHow is this story? From the days of this Chozla Kingdom \\nbeing established, I have never heard of such interference \\nfrom  women in the politics of the nation. How l ong can I \\ntolerate such humiliation?  If all of you unanimously agree, \\nI shall give up my official positions which trouble me to \\nlevy taxes and fill the treasury, and go back to my own \\ncity.\"\\n\"No! Never. Lord Pazluvoor should not forsake us like \\nthat. The Chozla Empire has been established with the aid \\nof thousands of brave men shedding their blood over four \\ngenerations; such a nation will be torn apart in confusion \\nwithin a short time if he does that,\"  said Lord \\nSambuvaraya.\\n\"Well then, you should all g ive me your ideas about what \\nto do in this situation. What is the solution to this women\\'s \\nrule which is worse than the power of the amazonian \\nQueen Alli?\" asked Lord Pazluvoor.\\n*****Ponniyin Selvan\\n', 8: ' Who Is In The Palanquin?\\nFor a while, the men in that meeting talked and argued \\namongst themselves. Since several voices were raised at \\nthe same time, Vandiya Devan could not hear anything \\nclearly.\\nIn a louder voice, Lord Sambuvaraya said, \"Don\\'t we have \\nto answer the requests of the King of Pa zluvoor? What is \\nthe point of each one talking like this? It seems to be hours \\npast midnight. Look at the moon!\"\\n\"I have a certain doubt. Some others also, like me, may \\nhave a similar reservation. If Lord Pazluvoor promises not \\nto be angry, I would like t o ask about it,\" said a hoarse \\nvoice which had spoken once before.\\n\"Is it Vanangamudi Raya, who is talking? Please, let him \\ncome forward into the light,\" said Lord Pazluvoor. \\n\"Yes, it is me! Here, I have come up into the light.\"\\n\"It is customary for me  to show all my anger in the \\nbattlefield and against my enemies. I have no anger against \\nfriends. Therefore, please ask any question without any \\nhesitation.\"\\n\"I will surely do so. The allegations against Emperor \\nSundara Chozla, those very same accusations  are placed \\nagainst Lord Pazluvoor by some people! I may not believe \\nthem, but I would like some clarification,\" said \\nVanangamudi Munai Raya.\\n\"What are they? What charges? Please explain.\"\\n\"We all know that Lord Pazluvoor married a young girl \\nabout two years ago...\"\\nWith an angry voice, Lord Sambuvaraya interrupted: \"We \\nobject to such words by Munai Raya. It is totally \\nindecorous to ask such improper questions of our beloved \\nleader, our chief guest.\"\\n\"I request Lord Sambuvaraya to please remain patient.  Let \\nMunai Raya express his reservations freely. It is better to \\nvoice one\\'s opinions in the open than bury them in the \\nmind. It is true that I married a young girl after my fifty -\\nfifth year. I certainly accept that. But, I never declared \\nmyself as a reincarnation of Lord Rama who vowed to \\nhave only one wife! I never said that I will wed only one \\nmaid. I love that girl; she returned my sentiment. \\nAccording to the ancient tenets of this Tamil country, \\nwillingly, we married each other. What is wrong in that?\"\\nasked Lord Pazluvoor.\\n\"Nothing wrong!\" replied several voices.0\"I never said there was anything wrong about his marriage. \\nWho amongst us is monogamous?  But ... but ...\"\\n\"But what? Ask without reluctance.\"\\n\"Some people say that in all matters Lord Paz luvoor \\nconsults and acts according to the wishes of the Young -\\nQueen he married recently. They say that he acts according \\nto her direction even in matters of the state. It is said that \\nhe takes his Young-Queen along wherever he goes.\"\\nA laugh was heard in their midst.\\nLord Sambuvaraya jumped up. \"Who laughed? Let him \\ncome forward and explain why he laughed!\" he roared \\nwhile drawing his sword from its scabbard.\\n\"I laughed! Don\\'t be agitated Sambuvaraya!\" said Lord \\nPazluvoor. He then continued, \"Munai Raya!  Is it a crime \\nto take my legally wedded wife wherever I go? It is true \\nthat I take her with me to visit several places. But it is \\ninaccurate to say that I consider the Young -Queen\\'s \\nopinion in matters of the state.  I have never done that.\"\\n\"If so, I request Lord Pazluvoor to clear just one more \\ndoubt. Why has this palanquin, which should have stayed \\nin the women\\'s courtyard, come here to our confidential \\nmeeting? Is there someone inside the closed palanquin or \\nnot? If there is no one inside, how is it th at I heard \\nsomebody clearing their throat? Was it the jingle of \\nbangles that I heard inside, a little while ago?\" \\nWhen Munai Raya asked these questions, a curious silence \\nprevailed amidst that gathering.  Since these doubts had \\noccurred to most of them, none spoke against the words of \\nMunai Raya. Lord Sambuvaraya was muttering something \\nto himself. But nothing was said.\\nTearing the silence apart, in a distinct voice, Lord \\nPazluvoor said, \"Good question. I am obligated to give an \\nanswer. I shall clear you r misgivings before we conclude \\nour meeting. Can you wait another half an hour? Do you \\nhave that much trust in me?\"\\n\"Yes we do. We have complete trust in you, Lord \\nPazluvoor,\" said Sambuvaraya.\\n\"Let no one think that my reverence or loyalty to Lord \\nPazluvoor is less than that of anyone else. Since he invited \\nus to speak freely, I asked. Apart from that I am ready to \\nobey all his orders. I shall give up my very life if he \\ncommands it!\" said Vanangamudi Munai Raya.\\n\"I know about Munai Raya. I also recogniz e the trust you \\nhave all placed in me. Therefore, let us now come to a \\nconclusion about the matter for which we convened this \\nmeeting. Let Emperor Sundara Chozla Paranthaka live \\nlong in this world and rule this Chozla Empire for a long \\ntime. However, unfortunately, if something happens to \\nhim: if the words of the palace doctors\\' come true, if the omens forecast by the comet appearing in the sky come \\ntrue -- we have to decide who is eligible to succeed to the \\nChozla throne.\"\\n\"We request that you state your opinion on this matter. \\nThere is no one here who has anything to say against your \\nviews.\"\\n\"That is not correct. Each one of you must think and then \\nexpress an impartial opinion. Permit me to recall some old \\nhistory to your memories.  Twenty -four years ago, King \\nGandara Aditya who was a great philosopher and devout \\nsoul, died unexpectedly. When he died, his son, \\nMadurandaka, was a one year old child. The Queen -\\nconsort of Gandara Aditya, the Lady Sembiyan Madevi, \\nannounced to us, the wishes of the King: his younger \\nbrother Arinjaya was to accept the Chozla throne after \\nhim. Therefore, we crowned Prince Arinjaya as the Chozla \\nmonarch. However, fate did not decree that Arinjaya \\nshould sit on the throne for more than a year. When \\nArinjaya died,  his son, Paranth aka Sundara Chozla, was a \\nyouth of twenty-four. Considering the welfare of the \\nnation, all of us -- the ministers, advisors, territorial \\nchieftains the heads of all the clans and leaders of the cities \\nand districts -- decided unanimously, and crowned Sunda ra \\nChozla. None of us had cause to regret this. Because, until \\ntwo years ago, he ruled the nation with justice; he \\nrespected our wishes and opinions and ruled this country \\nlawfully. Because of him the Chozla power grew to \\ninclude all neighboring nations un der its sway. \\n\"Now, the health of Sundara Chozla is cause for concern. \\nIn this situation, who is eligible to succeed the Emperor? \\nMadurandaka, the cherished son of King Gandara Aditya, \\nis now grown up; he has the intelligence, education, the \\ncharacter, the devotion to God, all the qualities of a person \\nworthy of the throne. Sundara Chozla\\'s son, Aditya \\nKarikala, who is younger to him by one year, is stationed \\nin Kanchi as a Commander -in-Chief. Who between these \\ntwo has the right to succeed to the throne? What is the \\ncode of inheritance among the clans? What is the law? \\nWhat is the ancient tradition of the Tamils? Is it justice if \\nthe elder brother\\'s son, Madurandaka inherits the nation? \\nOr, is it legal for the grand -son of the younger brother to \\nsucceed? Each of you must consider this and clearly state \\nyour decision.\"\\n\"Madurandaka, the son of the elder brother Gandara \\nAditya has the right to succeed. That is legal, justice, \\ntradition,\" said Lord Sambuvaraya.\\n\"I agree\", \"That is my opinion too,\" so rose se veral voices. \\n\"Your convictions are mine. Madurandaka deserves the \\nthrone. However, is everyone here ready to support and \\nfurther this belief? Are you all ready to sacrifice your lives, \\nyour wealth and very soul for this cause? This very minute, \\nare you all ready to swear in the name of Goddess Durga \\nand take an oath of allegiance?\"  When Lord Pazluvoor 1asked this question his voice had a certain harshness, not \\nheard till then.\\nSilence prevailed for some time.  Lord Sambuvaraya then \\nsaid, \"We are ready to take such an oath of support.  \\nBefore that, we need one clarification. What are the \\nfeelings of Prince Madurandaka? Is he ready to accept the \\nthrone and rule this Empire? We have heard that the \\ncherished son of Gandara Aditya has forsaken the \\npleasures of worldly life and is fully involved in the \\ndevotion and worship of God Shiva. Several persons have \\nsaid that he has no interest in worldly kingdoms. We have \\nalso heard that his mother, the Elder Pirati Sembiyan \\nMadevi is totally opposed to his ascending t he throne. We \\nwish to know the truth about this from you.\"\\n\"A good point and you raised it at the correct time. I must \\nclarify this question. I should have explained earlier --\\nforgive me for not doing so,\" with this long introduction \\nLord Pazluvoor spoke as follows: \"The whole nation \\nknows that the Lady Sembiyan Madevi discouraged her \\nonly son from having any interest in affairs of the state and \\nraised him as a Saiva ascetic. But, neither nation nor \\npeople know the reason behind such behavior.  The Elder \\nPirati feared that his very life would be in danger if her son \\nMadurandaka had any wish to rule the empire ... \"\\n\"Aha! Is that so!\"\\n\"Yes! To any mother, the wish  that the son to whom she \\ngave birth should stay well and alive is greater than a \\ndesire that he should sit upon the throne of the Kingdom. \\nYoung Prince Madurandaka, who considered the words of \\nhis mother as gospel, turned his mind in the path of \\ndevotion and asceticism. Nevertheless, for sometime, his \\nmind has slowly undergone some transformatio n. `This \\nChozla Empire is mine; it is my duty to rule the nation!\\' \\nsuch thoughts have taken root and grown in his heart. If he \\nknows that all of you are ready to support his cause, he is \\nready to come forward at a suitable time and openly \\ndeclare his intentions.\" \\n\"What proof do we have for this?\"\\n\"I will, without delay, produce proof that will satisfy all of \\nyou. If I furnish such proof, will each of you take an oath \\nof allegiance to this cause?\"\\nSeveral of the men said \"We will! We will!\"\\n\"I hope no one has any other kind of reservation?\"\\n\"No! None!\"\\n\"Then, I shall show proof. I shall also clear the doubts \\nraised by Lord Vananga -mudi Munai Raya.\" With this \\ndeclaration, Lord Pazluvoor rose from his seat. Walking \\nmajestically, he neared the closed pala nquin. \"Prince! Please part the curtains and grace the outside with \\nyour appearance. Permit these brave warriors, who are \\nready to sacrifice their very life, wealth and soul for you, \\nto gaze upon your face.\" Lord Pazluvoor spoke in a very \\ndeferential voice.\\nVandiya Devan, who was sitting behind the pillar on the \\nupper terrace and listening to all these discussions with an \\noverpowering curiosity, now peeped down carefully. As \\nbefore, a hand parted the curtains of the palanquin. It too \\nwas a golden hand. It seemed to be the very same fair hand \\nhe had seen once before. But he now realized that he had \\nsurmised the golden bracelet worn by royalty to be a \\nbangle. A dazzling face, comparable to the full moon, \\ncould be seen the very next instant. A handsome figu re, \\ncomparable to Manmatha, the God of Love, stepped out of \\nthe palanquin and smiled. \\nAha! Is this Prince Madurandaka, son of Gandara Aditya \\nDeva?  I mistook him to be a woman? I concluded that it \\nmust be a girl, because of the closed palanquin!?  But, d id \\nAzlvar-adiyan Nambi also make the same mistake?  \\nVandiya Devan looked around to see if Nambi was still \\nthrusting his head above the wall. That spot of the palace \\nwall was now shrouded by shadows cast by the trees. He \\ncould see nothing.\\nBy now he heard some shouts from below. \"Long Live \\nMadurandaka! Praise the Crown -Prince Madurandaka! \\nVictory to our brave spears!\" They were passionate \\noutbursts. Vandiya Devan saw that all the men in the \\ncourtyard were now standing; they held their swords and \\nspears high up above their heads and cheered. Thinking \\nthat it would be dangerous to remain any longer in that \\nspot, he turned around and hurried back to his terrace and \\nlaid himself down.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 9: ' Wayside Chitchat\\nVandiya Devan had spent  all his life until that day, in the \\ndry lands north of the River Palar. Consequently, he did \\nnot know how to swim in a flowing river. Once, when he \\nwas in the army on border patrol along the banks of the \\nNorth Pennar, he waded into the river for a bath. H e was \\ncaught in a swollen whirlpool. That sinister and devilish \\nwhirlpool made him go round and round. At the same time \\nit dragged him downwards. Very soon the whirlpool had \\ndrained all his strength. I cannot escape now; I have to \\ndrown in this whirlpool a nd die! -- just as he lost hope he \\nwas thrown out, by God\\'s grace. The waves threw him on \\nthe shores and saved him.\\nWhen he went back to bed that night in Kadamboor, he \\nexperienced the same feeling he had while caught in the \\nwhirlpool.  He felt that with no choosing of his own, he 2had fallen into the huge whirlpool of a political conspiracy. \\nCould he escape from this swirling treachery just as he had \\nescaped from that whirlpool?\\nThe information he had gleaned from the midnight \\nmeeting at Kadamboor baffled  him. The dangers from \\nexternal enemies to the Chozla Empire had been overcome \\nonly a few years ago. Prince Aditya Karikala -- brave, \\nexpert in warfare, a veritable Chanakya in politics; with his \\nintelligence and optimum use of the capable Chozla \\narmies, he routed the powers of the Rashtrakuta monarch, \\nKing Krishna, from the Thondai lands. In a way the \\nexternal enemies were destroyed. Now, internal disruption \\nand intrigue were raising their head. What would be the \\nconsequence of this internal discord which is more \\ndangerous than external strife?\\nAre not the important officials,  ministers, chieftains and \\nfamous warriors of the Chozla nation involved in this \\nfrightening endeavor? What kind of persons are the Lord \\nof Pazluvoor and his brother? What is their p ower? How \\nmuch prestige do they have? What about the others who \\nmet here today? They are all powerful, distinguished and \\neminent personalities. Is this the first meeting of this kind?  \\nI wonder; to how many other places has the Prince been \\ntaken in a closed palanquin by Lord Pazluvoor? Aha! The \\nfact of being married to a young girl in his old age has \\nserved him so usefully in this conspiracy!\\nUntil that day, no doubt about Prince Karikala\\'s eligibility \\nto the Chozla throne had risen in Vandiya Devan\\'s mind . \\nHe had not even dreamed that a challenge would arise. Of \\ncourse, he had heard of Madurandaka, the son of King \\nGandara Aditya. He had heard that, like the father the son \\nwas an ardent worshipper of God Shiva. But he had never \\nheard anything about his righ ts to the succession or that he \\nwould demand his rights. In fact Vandiya Devan had never \\nthought about such things.\\nWhat is the legality, the justice? Who is truly eligible to \\nsucceed to the throne? Karikala? Madurandaka?  The more \\nhe thought about it, he felt that both sides had equal \\njustification. If it really comes to a confrontation, who will \\ncome out victorious? What is my duty in this situation? \\nAha! I started on this journey from Kanchi while building \\nall sorts of dream fortresses. I desired to att ain eminent \\npositions in the Chozla Empire by pleasing the Crown \\nPrince Karikala! I even hoped that in due course I would \\nregain the ancestral territories of my Vaanar clan. The very \\nlimb that I caught hold of, to achieve all these dreams, \\nseems ready to drop! ... Thinking of all such things when \\nhe came to bed the second time that night, Vandiya Devan \\nsuffered with sleeplessness for a long time. In the end, \\ntowards the late hours of the night just as the eastern skies \\nwere turning light, he somehow went to  sleep. \\nThe next morning, Vandiya Devan did not get up even \\nwhen the golden-red rays of the rising sun fell piercingly \\nupon him. He was jolted awake when Kandamaran came \\nand shook his shoulders. With the courtesy shown to any guest, Kandamaran asked, \"Di d you sleep well?\" And then \\nhe added, \"After all my other guests had gone to sleep, I \\ncame up here and checked; you excelled in service like \\nKumbakarna (a mythical hero who slept half his lifetime)!\"\\nStifling everything that he remembered, Vandiya Devan \\nsaid, \"All that I recall is coming up to bed after the gypsy \\ndance. I am just getting up! Oh, ho! It is already so late: it \\nmust be several hours past sunrise. I have to start \\nimmediately. Kandamara, tell your servants to get my \\nhorse ready.\"\\n\"This is really fine! How can you leave so soon? What is \\nthe hurry? You must stay here for at least ten days before \\nyou go on,\" said Kandamaran.\\n\"No, my dear fellow! I had news that my uncle in Tanjore \\nwas in a bad  shape; his survival itself is doubtful. I have to \\ngo quickly to see him before he is gone. I must leave \\nimmediately.\" Vandiya Devan said this with total \\nconviction, without any hesitation.\\n\"You must then stay here for a while, at least when you go \\nback.\"\\n\"Why not? We shall think of it at that time. Permit  me to \\nleave now.\"\\n\"Don\\'t be in such a hurry. We can start after the morning \\nmeal. I shall accompany you till the banks of River \\nKollidam.\"\\n\"How can you do that? You have all sorts of important \\nguests. How can you leave them and ...\"\\n\"I have no guest more important than you ...\" saying this \\nKandamaran stopped suddenly. \"Yes the guests are \\nimportant people. But my father can take care of them. The \\nother officials of this palace can do that. I could not chat \\nwith you even last night. I can rest in peace on ly if I \\nchitchat with you for a little while, along the road. I shall \\ncertainly come with you till the Kollidam.\"\\n\"I have no objection. Your wish. Your convenience,\" said \\nVandiya Devan.\\nAfter more than two hours, both friends mounted on two \\nhorses started from Lord Sambuvaraya\\'s palace. The \\nhorses cantered quite slowly. The ride was rather pleasant. \\nThe friends did not seem to mind even the road dust \\nsprayed upon them by the swift northern wind. They had \\nlost themselves in old remembrances. After some tim e \\nVandiya Devan said: \"Kandamara! Even though I spent \\njust one night in your house, it was very useful to me. Just \\none disappointment. You used to recount all sorts of things \\nabout your sister, while we were on the banks of the North \\nPennar. I could not even see her properly! When she \\npeeped from hiding behind your mother, I could glimpse \\nabout one-eighth of her face! Your sister seems to possess 3a shyness and modesty that is more than any one girl\\'s \\nshare.\"\\nKandamaran\\'s lips twitched as if to say somethin g. But no \\nwords came out.\\n\"Still, no regrets. You have invited me to stay with you for \\na few days on my way back. I can make her acquaintance \\nat that time. By that time your younger sister may be able \\nto overcome her shyness about me. Kandamara, what is \\nyour sister\\'s name?\"\\n\"Manimekala.\"\\n\"Oh! What a delightful name! If her character and beauty \\nare like the name...\"\\nKandamaran intervened and said in a forlorn voice, \"My \\nfriend! I beg this one thing of you. Please forget my sister. \\nPlease forget all that I mentioned about her to you. Do not \\neven utter her name.\"\\n\"What is this Kandamara? Every thing seems topsy -turvy? \\nEven last night you hinted that I may become a son -in-law \\nto your clan!\"\\n\"It is true that I said it. Since then the situation has \\nchanged. My parents have arranged to wed my young \\nsister elsewhere. Manimekala has also agreed.\"\\nVandiya Devan cheered within his heart: \"Long live \\nManimekala.\" He did not have any trouble guessing who \\nwas selected to wed Manimekala. They must have pledged \\nher to Madurandaka who stepped out of the closed \\npalanquin. They are perhaps arranging such marriage \\nalliances in order to gain strength for the Prince\\'s cause. \\nLord Pazluvoor is a dangerous and capable politician.\\n\"Oh! You have contracted one of your rich guest s who \\ncame last night as the bridegroom. Kandamara, I have no \\nsurprise about this; nor am I really disappointed. In a way \\nit was expected.\"\\n\"Expected? How is that?\"\\n\"Who would give their daughter to a destitute -orphan like \\nme? Which maid will agree to ma rry a poor fellow who \\nhas neither house nor land. What is the use now if my \\nancestors had ruled kingdoms long ago?\"\\n\"My dear friend! Enough of this, stop!  Don\\'t think so \\nshoddily of me or my family. What you think, is not the \\nreason. There is something m uch more important. You will \\nagree if you know of it. But I cannot reveal the reason \\nnow. When the time comes you will know.\"\\n\"Kandamara, what is this? You have been talking quite \\nmysteriously today.\"\"Forgive me for that. It is a big secret that I canno t reveal \\neven to you. Whatever happens, trust me that nothing will \\ncome between our friendship. When it is time to reveal \\nplans, I will run to you and disclose all the details. Trust \\nme until then.\"\\n\"Thanks for the pledge! But what is the situation wherei n \\nyou may have to forsake me? And, I am not one to live \\nupon my faith in somebody else. I trust my own sword and \\nspear.\"\\n\"There may be an opportunity to use that sword and that \\nspear soon. At that time I hope we will fight side by side. \\nYour dreams also may then be fulfilled.\"\\n\"What is this? Are you soon expecting some war? Or, are \\nyou planning to enter the battlefields of Lanka?\"\\n\"To Lanka? You will be surprised if you hear the details of \\nthe ridiculous campaign in Lanka. I believe we have to \\nsupply the rice and other foodstuffs from Chozla country \\nfor the soldiers fighting in Lanka. Shameful! I am talking \\nabout something else. Be patient for a while. I will tell you \\nat the right time. Don\\'t kindle my mouth now.\"\\n\"Alright. If you don\\'t wish, don\\'t tell me anything. Don\\'t \\neven open your mouth. I think I can see the river ahead of \\nus.\" \\nThey could really see the torrents of the immense River \\nKollidam at the end of the road. Within a few minutes the \\nfriends reached the river bank.\\nThe fresh floods of the spring month filled that great river. \\nThe far side seemed very distant. Trees on the other shore \\nseemed like small bushes. Reddish silt laden waters, filled \\nwith rapids and whirlpools drawing fantastic pictures, \\nthundering joyously, celebrating with a loud  roaring sound, \\ntrying to break through the high banks on both sides, \\nrolling and tumbling towards the eastern sea, rushing \\nonwards  -- Vandiya Devan looked upon this sight and \\nstood there in amazement.\\nA ferry boat waited near the landing wharf. Two boat men \\nwith long poles in their hands waited readily. One \\ngentleman was already seated in the boat. He appeared to \\nbe of the Saiva sect. Catching sight of the two men coming \\nupon the bank, a boatman asked, \"Sirs! Are you both \\ncoming in this boat?\"\\n\"Yes. He will come. Wait for a while.\"\\nBoth friends jumped off their horses. \"I came without \\nthinking. What can I do with this horse of mine? Can it go \\nin the boat?\" asked Vandiya Devan. \\n\"No need. There! Look! Two of my footmen are following \\nus. One of them will lead your horse back to Kadamboor. \\nThe other fellow will come with you in this boat. He will 4procure another horse for you on the other shore,\" said \\nKandamaran.\\n\"Aha! How thoughtful. You are my true friend.\"\\n\"You must have thought of the Kollidam as comp arable to \\nthe Palar and Pennar rivers. You wouldn\\'t have known that \\nyou cannot cross this river with a horse.\"\\n\"Yes. Forgive me for under -estimating the rivers of your \\nChozla lands. Gosh! What a river! What floods? It seems \\nto roar like the ocean.\"\\nThe two friends took leave of each other with a hearty \\nembrace. Vandiya Devan walked down the river bank and \\ngot into the boat. One of Kandamaran\\'s footmen also \\nclimbed into the boat. The boat was ready to leave. The \\nboatmen thrust their long poles deep into th e water.\\nSuddenly, from a distance they could hear shouts: \"Stop! \\nStop the boat!\" said a voice. The boatmen hesitated \\nwithout pushing their poles. The fellow who shouted came \\nrunning up the bank. With one glance, Vandiya Devan \\nrecognized him. He was Azlva r-adiyan Nambi. \\nRecognizing the newcomer as a follower of the Vaishnava \\nsect, the gentleman in the boat said \"Go! Let the boat go! I \\nwill not come in the same boat as that imposter. Let him \\ncome in the next ferry.\"\\nBut Vandiya Devan looked at the boatmen and said, \"Wait \\na bit. Let him also come. There is plenty of room in this \\nferry boat. Let us take him.\" Vandiya Devan wished to \\nquestion Azlvar-adiyan and learn more about the \\nhappenings of last night. \\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 10: ' The Astrologer Of Kudanthai\\nRiver Ponni, born and raised in the Kudagu Hills, after her \\nchildhood was past, wished to meet the Ocean King, her \\nchosen husband. She went swiftly, crossing hill and dale, \\nrocky mountain and canyon. As she came closer and \\ncloser, the joyous anticipation of meeting her beloved \\nLord, the Ocean King, made her thrive and grow. She went \\neven further. Two arms grew to embrace the lover. \\nSpreading her arms wide, she leaped and surged forward. \\nTwo arms were not sufficient for her ardent enthusiasm. \\nHer loving arms grew into ten, twenty, hundred! Stretching \\nout all these arms in eagerness she neared the Ocean King. \\nShe was the bride meeting her beloved. Chozla women, \\nher bridesmaids, dressed her in such wondrous ways. They \\nclothed her in the beautiful  greens of rice-fields. They \\ndecorated her with colorful flowers; and showered her with \\nfragrant woods. How can we describe the enchanting \\nkadamba and punnai trees on both her banks: they covered \\nher with pearls and rubies of flowers. Who would not be overjoyed to cast their eyes upon you, \\ndear Ponni?  Which maid will not be beguiled by this, your \\nbridal attire? It is but natural that attractive young girls \\nshould gather around you just as bridesmaids surround a \\nravishing bride. \\nOne of the arms stretche d out by Ponni or Cauvery, to \\nreach out for her Lord the Ocean King, is known by the \\nname River Arisil. The beautiful Arisil flows to the south \\nof and very close to River Cauvery. One could not easily \\nview this petite river from a little distance. The grov es of \\ntrees, growing thickly on both its banks hide the river. One \\ncould consider the Arisil as a princess who never stepped \\nout of the enclosed courtyards of a royal palace. There is \\nno comparison to this beautiful virgin river.\\nLet our readers forget th at it is the inner courtyard of a \\npalace and come with us to the banks of the Arisil river. \\nLet them enter these woody groves on its banks. Oh! What \\nan enchanting sight meets our eyes! It seems to add \\nradiance to beauty; to add sweetness to nectar.\\nWho are these divine women, seated on the beautifully \\ncarved barge, constructed like a floating swan? Who is the \\nradiant jewel among women, seated in their midst, like the \\nfull moon among twinkling stars, like a queen born to rule \\nall seven worlds? Who is the ge ntle damsel seated next to \\nher, playing the veena (lute like instrument)? Who are \\nthese heavenly beauties coming down the stream, mixing \\nthe pleasant melody of their music with the gurgling noises \\nof the river? \\nOne of them had large eyes shaped like dart ing fish; the \\nother was blue eyed; yet another had a face like the \\nblossoming lotus; another girl had wide dark eyes shaped \\nlike the petal of a blue lily. Ah! The girl playing the \\nmusical instrument, one could watch forever, her soft \\nfingers dancing over the taunt strings  of the veena.\\nWhat can we say about the sweetness of the song they \\nsang? Even the water in the river seemed to be still as it \\nlistened to their melodious music. Even the cuckoos and \\nparrots on the trees listened quietly. We humans, bless ed \\nwith the fortune of being able to listen, why should we not \\nbe enchanted by their song? Let us listen to them:\\nWalk slowly, walk shyly,Praise to you, dear Cauvery;\\nDress yourself in beautiful clothes:Fragrant gardens full of humming bees;Open wide, those large dark eyes:Dancing fish of deep dark seas;\\nDancing does not melt a lovers heart:Like a good monarch\\'s mace of justice;\\nWhen nightingales sing in deep woods;And peacocks dance amidst flower groves;Dance gently, dear Cauvery:You disturb the garlands on Kama\\'s shoulders.The garlands at his waist are all asway;What caused it? The very name of your dear Lord:5An expert spear like dart;\\nWalk slowly, walk shyly,Praise to you, dear Cauvery.\\nWhere have we heard this delightful Tamil poem? Oh  yes, \\nis it not from The Silappadikaram (an ancient poetical \\nwork)? The poem seems even more enchanting and \\ndelightful when these maids sing it. Perhaps they are the \\nmaids of honor in River Arisil\\'s court? Or is this the magic \\nof some sorcerer? It entices every beholder.\\nThe barge floated down gently till it stopped near a landing \\namidst the woods. Two maidens are getting down. One is \\nthat dignified lady, comparable to a queen of the seven \\nworlds; the other is her companion who was creating the \\nenchanting harmony while playing the veena.  Though \\nboth are beautiful, there was a difference between the two \\nof them. One has the dignity of a lotus blossom in full \\nbloom. The other has the pleasantness of the night -time \\nwater lily. One is the radiant full moon; th e other is the \\nyoung crescent of late evening. One is the dancing \\npeacock; the other is a singing nightingale. One is a queen \\nof the Gods; her friend is Rathi, the beloved of Cupid. She \\nis the fast flowing turbulent Ganga. Her companion is the \\ngentle Cauvery.\\nWithout further ado, without leaving our readers in further \\nsuspense, let me introduce these two ladies. The lady with \\na certain dignity in her posture is Kundavai, the beloved \\ndaughter of Emperor Sundara Chozla. She is the elder \\nsister to Arulmozli Varma who would later attain historic \\nfame as Rajaraja I. She is the lady revered by the people as \\nthe young royal princess, the Younger Pirati. A \\ndistinguished daughter of the Tamils, she laid the \\nfoundations for the greatness of the Chozla Empire. She is \\nthe capable lady who will raise and mould the ambitions of \\nRajaraja\\'s son Rajendra and make him the greatest of \\nmonarchs in South Indian history.\\nHer friend is Vanathi, a noblewoman from the clan of \\nKodumbalur chieftains. She came to enjoy the fortune of \\nbeing a part of Kundavai\\'s household. In the future she \\nwould attain greatness unparalleled in history. She is now \\na young girl, full of modesty and a pleasant gentleness.\\nAfter both had alighted from the barge, Kundavai turned to \\nher other companions and  said, \"You can all wait here. We \\nwill be back in an hour.\"\\nAll those maids, who were her companions, were \\nnoblewomen from the households of the aristocrats and \\nchieftains in the Chozla nation. They had come to the \\nPazlayarai Palace, considering it a fort une to be included \\nas maids of honor to Kundavai. Now, when Kundavai went \\nashore with just one girl from among them, saying, \"I\\'ll \\ncome after a while,\" a certain envy and disappointment \\ncould be discerned in their eyes.A horse drawn chariot awaited their  pleasure on the shore. \\n\"Vanathi! Get into the chariot,\" said Kundavai. When both \\nwere seated, the chariot moved swiftly. \\n\"Akka! Where are we going? Can you tell me?\" asked \\nVanathi.\\n\"Why not? We are going to the house of the Kudanthai \\nAstrologer,\" said Kundavai.\\n\"Why are we going to an astrologer\\'s house, Akka? What \\ndo we have to ask him?\"\\n\"What else? To ask about you! For some months now you \\nseem to be a girl possessed, lost in some dream world, \\nlosing weight. We are going to ask him if you will be \\ncured of these fantasies and become healthy once again. \\nWe are going to ask him all these things!\"\\n\"Akka! Let good fortune be showered upon you! There is \\nnothing wrong with my health. We don\\'t have to ask him \\nanything about me. Let\\'s go back.\"\\n\"No, my dear no! I am not going to ask him anything about \\nyou. I shall ask him about me!\"\\n\"What do you have to ask about yourself? What is there to \\nask an astrologer about yourself?\"\\n\"I am going to ask him if I would ever be married; or am I \\ngoing to spend all my li fe a virgin maid!\"\\n\"Akka! Why ask the astrologer about it? You have to ask \\nyour own heart! Just nod you gracious head: princes from \\nall the fifty-six kingdoms from Cape Comorin to the \\nHimalayas would come running, vying with each other. \\nWhy, even princes from across the seas from Yavana and \\nKadaram will come. I wonder which of these princes will \\nhave the fortune of receiving your hand. You have to \\ndetermine that!\"\\n\"Vanathi, even if I accept all that you say as truth, there is \\none obstacle. If I marry any one of these princes from an \\nalien nation, I will have to go with him to his kingdom. My \\ndear, I have a great dislike to go away from this delightful \\nChozla Kingdom where the Ponni flows! I have taken an \\noath that I will not go to another kingdom from here .. ...\"\\n\"That is no obstacle! Any prince that marries you will stay \\nat your feet as your slave. If you order him to stay here he \\nwill remain here.\"\\n\"Oh dear Lord! That will be like picking up a rat and tieing \\nit up in your waistband! How can we retain an  alien prince \\nin our lands? Do you know the consequences of such \\nactivity?\"\\n\"Anyway, whatever you say, a person born as a woman \\nwill one day have to be married. Is that not so?\"6\"No law says that my dear. Vanathi, think of the Lady \\nAvvaiyar. Did she not live for a long time as a queen \\namong poets but a virgin maid?\"\\n\"Because of a boon from the Gods Avvaiyar became an \\nold maid in her young age. You are not like that.\"\\n\"Well if I do have to be married, I think I shall choose an \\norphan Chozla warrior for m y consort. That fellow will not \\nhave any kingdom. He will not demand that I go to another \\nnation. He will remain here itself, in this Chozla country.\"\\n\"Akka, does it mean that you will never leave these Chozla \\nTerritories?\"\\n\"Never will I leave. Even if t hey offer to crown me as a \\nqueen of the heavens, I will not leave!\"\\n\"Now I am quite happy.\"\\n\"How is that?\"\\n\"If you move to another kingdom, I will have to follow \\nyou. I cannot be parted from you. At the same time I have \\nno heart to leave this bountiful Chozla land!\"\\n\"If you are married, won\\'t you have to leave?\"\\n\"I am not going to marry anyone, Akka.\"\\n\"My dear girl! What happened to all the advise you were \\ngiving me just now?\"\\n\"Am I like you?\"\\n\"You deceiver! I know everything! Are you trying to \\nthrow dust in my eyes? You have no great love for this \\nChozla land. The Chozla nation you love is bearing sword \\nand spear and has gone to Lanka to conduct a campaign! \\nYou think that I do not know your secrets?\"\\n\"Akka! Akka! Am I so foolish? Where is the sun? and \\nwhere is the morning dewdrop? What is the use, if a \\ndewdrop wishes for the friendship of the fiery sun?\"\\n\"The dewdrop is small! And the sun is mighty and bright! \\nStill, does not the dewdrop impound the bright sunshine in \\nitself? Tell me?\"\\nVanathi now replied in a voice filled will cheer and \\neagerness: \"Are you saying that? Can a mere dewdrop \\nattain the sun?\" Then suddenly she felt depressed. \"The \\ndewdrop wishes to do so; in fact it enslaves the sunray! \\nBut what use? Within a short time it is severely punished. \\nIt dries up in the bright sunlight and disappears without a \\ntrace!\"\\n\"That is wrong, Vanathi. The sun recognizes the love of \\nthe dewdrop and merges her into himself. He thinks that \\nhis beloved maid, the dewdrop, should not be seen by other men. He lets her out again after darkness. Doesn\\'t the \\nhidden dewdrop appear again every morning?\"\\n\"Akka, you are telling me all these stories to cheer me up.\"\\n\"So! You do say that you need cheering up. There is some \\nsadness in your heart. All these days you m aintained that \\n`Nothing is wrong\\'. That is why I am going to the \\nAstrologer of Kudanthai.\"\\n\"If there is a sadness in my heart, what is the use of asking \\nan astrologer about it?\" sighed Vanathi.\\nThe house of the Kudanthai Astrologer was situated in the \\noutskirts of that city, in an isolated spot, besides a Kali \\ntemple. The chariot did not enter the city, but went around \\nand reached that house. From the way the charioteer drove \\nhis chariot without any hesitation or doubt, it appeared that \\nhe had driven there several times before. \\nThe Astrologer and one of his disciples waited readily \\noutside the house. The Astrologer welcomed his visitors \\nwith great reverence and courtesy.\\n\"Great lady! A reincarnation of both Kalaimagal (Goddess \\nof Learning) and Thirumaga l (Goddess of Wealth)! \\nWelcome. Welcome. It is the fortune of my humble abode \\nthat you have come in search of me once again!\"\\n\"Mr. Astrologer! I hope that nobody else will come in \\nsearch of you at this time?\" asked Kundavai.\\n\"No one will come Thaye!  Not  many people come in \\nsearch of me these days. Only when troubles in the world \\nincrease will people seek the astrologer. Nowadays, under \\nthe rule of your esteemed father -- The Emperor Sundara \\nChozla -- the people have no troubles at all! They possess \\nall the comforts and luxuries and live life with happiness. \\nWho will come in search of me?\"\\n\"Do you mean to say that I have some troubles and \\ntherefore, I have come to consult you?\" asked Kundavai.\\n\"No. Great lady, no. Which blind fool will say that the \\nbeloved daughter of Sundara Chozla who possesses \\nimmense wealth, has any troubles? Since the people have \\nno troubles, this poor astrologer is cast into misfortune. \\nNobody takes care of him. Therefore you have come here \\nlike a Goddess with solicitude for my trou bles. Please \\nenter and grace my humble house. Look at me, talking \\nwhile I detain you here on the doorstep!\" said the \\nresourceful Astrologer.\\nKundavai turned to the charioteer and said, \"Take the \\nchariot to the shade of the banyan tree behind the temple \\nand wait.\"\\nKundavai and Vanathi entered the Astrologer\\'s house as he \\nled them inside. The Astrologer turned to his disciple and \\nsaid warningly, \"Wait outside and guard the entrance 7carefully. Even if accidentally someone happens to come \\nby, do not let them enter.\"\\nThe parlor in the Astrologer\\'s house was decorated to \\nreceive his royal visitors. In an alcove in the wall was a \\ndecorated figure of the Goddess Devi. Two seats were \\nmade ready for seating the visitors. A tall metal lamp was \\nlit. The floor gleamed with intricate kolam decorations. \\nSeveral tablets and palm leaf charts with the scribbles and \\nsymbols of the astrologer\\'s trade were scattered about. \\nAfter both ladies were seated, the Astrologer sat down.\\n\"Madam, please tell me why you have come?\"\\n\"Sir! Can you not find out even that by your astrology?\" \\nasked Kundavai.\\n\"So be it, Thaye!\" said the Astrologer and closed his eyes. \\nHe muttered some incantations and after a while looked at \\nthem saying \"Lady, you have come here today, mainly to \\nask about the horoscope of this young girl. That is what the \\ngrace of the Goddess reveals to me.\"\\n\"Aha! Remarkable! How can we praise your powers? Yes \\nsir! I have come to ask about this girl. She came to the \\nPazlayarai Palace about a year ago. For the first eight \\nmonths she was very cheerful and happy. Amongst my \\ncompanions she was the most joyous, most filled with \\nplayful laughter. For the last four months, something has \\nhappened to her. Often, she seems depressed. She seems to \\nlive in some abstract world. She has for gotten her laughter. \\nShe says that nothing is wrong with her health. If her \\nparents come and ask me tomorrow, what reply can I \\ngive?\"\\n\"Thaye! Is she not the beloved daughter of the Lord of \\nKodumbalur? Is her name Vanathi Devi?\" asked the \\nAtrologer.\\n\"Yes; you seem to know everything.\"\\n\"I even have the horoscope of this young Lady.  I have it in \\nmy collection. Please wait a little.\"  \\nThe Astrologer opened an old casket by his side and \\nsearched awhile. He then picked up a palm leaf notation of \\na horoscope and peered at it.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 11: ' Sudden Entry\\nThe town known as Kumbakonam, was known as \\nKudanthai or Kudamooku during the times of our story. \\nBesides the virtue of being a pilgrimage center, it was also \\nfamous because of the Astro loger of Kudanthai. A little \\ndistance to the south of Kudanthai, a majestic view of the \\ninterim capital of the Chozla\\'s, Pazlayarai, with its temple towers and palace turrets reaching the skies, could be \\nglimpsed. \\nThe Astrologer of Kudanthai had collecte d the horoscopes \\nof all the royal family living at the Pazlayarai Palace. He \\nhad searched amidst this collection and found the \\nhoroscope of Lady Vanathi of Kodumbalur.  After peering \\nat the palm leaf notation of the horoscope for a while, he \\nstared at the face of Vanathi; then again looked at the \\nnotation. He was peering and staring one after the other, \\nbut did not open his mouth to utter a single word!\\nWith a little impatience Kundavai asked, \"What Sir? Are \\nyou going to say something or not?\"\\n\"Thaye! What can I say? How can I say it? I had studied \\nthis horoscope once before and could not believe it myself. \\nI doubted if anything could be like it and kept it aside. \\nNow, when I behold the divine face of this Lady and see \\nher horoscope at the same time, I am astounded!\"\\n\"Be amazed! Be astounded! After you have been \\nastounded enough, say something in particular.\"\\n\"Madam, this is a very fortunate horoscope. I am saying it \\nwith the belief that you will not mistake my words. This is \\none step better than even you r horoscope! I have never, till \\nnow, seen such a lucky horoscope.\"\\nKundavai smiled. Vanathi said with some shyness, \"Akka! \\nHe is calling this most unfortunate girl the luckiest person \\nin this world! Everything he utters will be like this.\"\\n\"Amma, what are you saying? If my statements are \\nincorrect, I will give up my practice!\" said the Astrologer.\\n\"No. Mr. Astrologer, no. Don\\'t do anything like that. Keep \\npredicting such good things to the people. But you are \\nuttering generalities; you have said nothing in particular. \\nThat is why she doubts you.\"\\n\"You want me to say something specific? Here, I will say \\nit. Four months ago, something that appeared to be an ill \\nomen occurred. Something slipped and fell. But in truth, \\nthat is not an ill omen. It is from tha t incident that this \\nLady will obtain all her good fortune.\"\\n\"Vanathi, remember what I said? See?\" said Kundavai \\nDevi.\\n\"You must have told him about it before!\" said Vanathi.\\n\"Sir, look at the way this girl talks?\"\\n\"Let her talk Thaye, let her say what ever she wants now. \\nTomorrow when she marries the king of kings ....\"\\n\"Yes, talk about such things! Young girls will listen \\nhappily if you speak to them about marriage.\"8\"That is what I have been saying too. If I suddenly raise \\nthe topic of marriage, peo ple will say `This old man has \\nlost his senses.\\' That is why ...\"\\n\"Where will her husband come from? When will he come? \\nWhat is his identification? Can you tell us all these things \\nfrom the horoscope, Sir?\"\\n\"Oh yes! Why not? I can say it very well.\"  The  Astrologer \\npeered into the horoscope once more. Whether he \\nexamined it carefully or pretended to do examine it, none \\ncan say!\\nThen looking up decisively he said, \"Madam! A husband \\nfor this maid does not have to come from very far! He is \\nquite nearby. However, that brave warrior is not in this \\ncountry now. He has gone across the seas.\"\\nUpon hearing these words, Kundavai looked at Vanathi. \\nVanathi tried to contain the happiness that bubbled in her \\nheart; but could not do so: her face showed it.\\n\"Then, who is he? What clan? Any signs to recognize \\nhim?\"\\n\"Oh yes. Very clear signs. A prince fortunate enough to \\nmarry this girl, will have the sign of the conch and discus \\non his palms.\" \\nOnce again Kundavai looked at Vanathi. But Vanathi was \\nlooking down, almost hiding her face. \"Won\\'t there be \\nsome signs or significant lines on her palms also?\" asked \\nKundavai Pirati. \\n\"Thaye! Have you ever seen the soles of this girl\\'s feet? ...\"\\n\"Sir! What are you saying? Are you asking me to touch her \\nfeet?\"\\n(Greeting a person by touching their feet denotes extreme \\nhumility, or servitude.)\\n\"No! Oh no! I am not saying anything like that! However, \\nsometime in the future, thousands of princesses, queens \\nand empresses will pray for the fortune of touching this \\nnoble lady\\'s feet.\"\\n\"Akka! This old man is teasing me. Is it for this, that you \\nbrought me here? Please get up; let us go\"  Vanathi said \\nthis with some real anger.\\n\"Why are you agitated my dear? Let him keep saying what \\nhe wants ...\"\\n\"I am not saying anything. I am ju st explaining the \\nnotations in this horoscope. Poets often talk about lotus \\nfeet. Please ask this Lady to show me her feet a little bit. \\nHer sole will surely have the line of the red -lotus.\"\"Well! That\\'s enough Sir. If you say anything more about \\nthis girl, she will get hold of my hands and drag me out. \\nTell us something about the man who is to be her \\nhusband.\"\\n\"Yes. Of course, I shall do so. The fortunate youth who \\nwill take her hand will be the bravest among brave; he will \\nwear the victory garlands fro m fighting in the forefront of \\nhundreds of campaigns. He will be a king of kings. With \\nthe praise and support of thousands of kings, he will sit \\nupon the throne of an emperor for a long time.\"\\n\"I do not believe your words. How is that possible?\" asked \\nKundavai. Several emotions -- eagerness, happiness, fear, \\ndoubt, worry -- danced on her face.\\n\"I too don\\'t believe it. He is thinking of something else and \\nsaying all this. He is uttering such words to make you \\nhappy!\" said Vanathi.\\n\"If you don\\'t believe my  words today, there is no harm. \\nOne day you will believe it. Don\\'t forget this poor \\nastrologer on that day.\"\\nVanathi asked once again: \"Akka, shall we go?\" Two tear \\ndrops peeped at the corners of her dark eyes.\\n\"I have to tell you just one more thing. Pl ease hear that \\nalso and then leave. There will be several obstacles and \\ndangers for the young man who is to marry this Princess. \\nHe will have several enemies ...\"\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\"But all the dangers and obstacles will fly away in the end. \\nEnemies will be totally destroyed; the Lord who attains \\nthis Lady will cross all impediments and achieve great \\npositions. There is something much more important than \\neven this ... Thaye! I am an old man. Therefore, I can \\nreveal all without hiding anything. You should look at the \\nstomach of this girl sometime. If you do not find the lines \\nand sign of a banyan (ficus) leaf on her stomach, I will \\ngive up my practice of astrology.\"\\n\"Sir, what is so special about the sign of the banyan leaf?\"\\n\"Don\\'t you know who the Lord who reposed on the banyan \\nleaf is? A son with the aspects of that great Vishnu will be \\nborn to her. Her Lord is likely to have all sorts of dangers, \\nobstacles, impediments and bad periods. But the son who \\nis to be born of this Lady will have nothing that is a \\ndeterrent. All that he thinks of will be concluded; anything \\nhe undertakes will be completed; his touch will be golden; \\nwherever he steps will be under his sway; whatever he sees \\nwill have the tiger-flag flying over it. Madam, the armies \\nled by her son will flow i n all directions, with no \\nhinderance, like the fresh floods of the Ponni. The Goddess \\nof Victory will be his bonded slave. The fame of his native \\nlands will spread across the worlds. The fame of his clan \\nwill last as long as this world exists!\"9When the Astrologer spoke these words as if in some \\nfrenzy, Kundavai was looking at him with rapt attention, \\nlistening to every word he uttered. She was startled to turn \\naround upon hearing the distressed call, \"Akka!\"  \\n\"Something is happening to me,\" said Vanathi  in further \\ndistress. Suddenly she fainted and fell to the floor.\\n\"Sir! Please fetch some water quickly,\" saying this, \\nKundavai lifted Vanathi onto her lap. The Astrologer \\nbrought some water. Kundavai sprinkled the water on her \\nfriends face.\\n\"Nothing will go wrong, Amma! Do not be concerned,\" \\nsaid the Astrologer.\\n\"I am not worried. This is her habit. This has happened \\nfour or five times till now. She will open her eyes and get \\nup after some time. Upon waking she will ask if this is the \\nearth or paradise,\" said Kundavai.\\nThen, in a much softer voice she asked \"Sir! I came to ask \\nyou something very important. Have you any news?\"\\nThe Astrologer\\'s manner changed; he said some words to \\nher very precisely and quickly.\\nThen, Kundavai Pirati asked, \"I hear tha t people in the \\ncountryside and cities are talking about all sorts of things. \\nThe long tailed comet has been appearing in the skies for \\nsometime. Is there some meaning to all this? Is there some \\ndanger to the empire? Will there be any change, \\nconfusion?\"\\n\"Lady, don\\'t ask me about that. There is no horoscope for \\nkingdoms, nations or political events; neither can I predict \\nanything by astrology about them. I know nothing about \\nsuch matters through the science I practice. Perhaps the \\nseers and philosophers or  the devout and ascetic may be \\nable to foresee something. This poor fellow does not have \\nsuch powers. In politics the stars and planets of astrology \\nhave no power.\"  The Astrologer spoke these words with  a \\ncertain emphasis, looking at Vanathi who seemed t o be \\nstirring.\\n\"Sir! You talk very skillfully. You don\\'t have to study the \\nhoroscope of a nation. But can you not reveal particulars \\nabout my father and my brothers? Isn\\'t studying their \\nhoroscopes like looking at the horoscope of the nation?\"\\n\"I will look into them at leisure and tell you. Thaye, in \\ngeneral this period is full of confusion and danger. All of \\nus have to be a little careful.\"\\n\"Sir! About my father..., the Emperor ... I am quite worried \\never since he moved to Tanjore from Pazlayarai.\"\\n\"I have told you earlier, Madam. This is a period of grave \\ndanger for the Emperor. All your family has to face great danger. With the grace of the Goddess Durga all will be \\novercome.\"\\n\"Akka, where are we?\" asked the faint voice of Vanathi.\\nVanathi, who had her head on Kundavai\\'s lap, blinked her \\neyelids several times like the buzzing bee, and looked \\naround.\\n\"Darling, we are still on this earth. The flower -laden \\nflying-chariot has not yet come to take us to the heavens. \\nGet up! Let us get into our mere horse  drawn chariot and \\ngo back to the palace.\"\\nVanathi sat up and asked, \"Did I faint?\"\\n\"No. You did not faint. You took a little nap on my lap. I \\neven sang you a lullaby. Did you not hear it?\"\\n\"Please do not scold me Akka. Without my awareness, I \\nfelt dizzy.\"\\n\"Yes. You will feel dizzy. Quite dizzy. If this Astrologer \\nhad predicted all those grand fortunes for me, even my \\nhead would feel dizzy.\"\\n\"Not because of that Akka. You think I believed \\neverything he said?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know if you believed it or not? B ut this Astrologer \\nwas quite worried about you. I should not take a poor \\nspirited person like you, anywhere, anymore.\"\\n\"I said that I did not want to come to this astrologer. You \\ninsisted ...\"\\n\"It is my fault. Get up. Let us go. Can you walk to the \\ndoorstep? Or, should I carry you on my hip?\\n\"No. No. I can walk very well.\"\\n\"Please have a little patience Thaye! I shall give you some \\nsacrament-offerings of the Goddess. Please receive them \\nbefore you go,\" said the Astrologer as he tidied his papers.\\n\"Sir, you described all sorts of things for me. But you did \\nnot say anything for Akka?\" asked Vanathi.\\n\"Amma, I have told everything to the Younger Pirati. \\nWhat is there to say afresh?\"\\n\"About the bravest of warriors who is to marry Akka ....\"\\n\"That dauntless gallant ....\" interrupted Kundavai with \\nsome surprise.\\n\"Doubtless. A very capable prince...\"\\n\"He who has all the thirty -two signs of good looks; Jupiter \\nin wisdom; a veritable Saraswati (deity of learning) in 0knowledge; handsome as Cupid, Oh no, as Arj una (epic \\nwarrior)!\"\\n\"When will that handsome prince, deserving of the \\nYounger Pirati come and where will he come from?\"\\n\"How will he come? Upon a horse? On a chariot? By \\nwalk? Or, will he rip open the roof and jump down from \\nthe skies?\" asked Kundavai w ith a mocking voice.\\n\"Akka, I can hear the hoof beats of a horse,\" Vanathi said \\nthis with some agitation.\\n\"You will hear most wonderful things unheard by anyone \\nelse.\"\\n\"No. I am not joking. Listen.\"\\nBy now all three could hear the quick gallop of a hor se on \\nthe road outside.\\n\"What if you hear it? Won\\'t horses gallop along the road?\" \\nsaid Kundavai.\\n\"No. It seems to be coming here, to this house.\"\\n\"OK. Get up. Let us go.\"\\nAt this time they could hear some confused noises outside \\nthe door. Voices could  be heard.\\n\"Is this the Astrologer\\'s house?\"\\n\"Yes; who are you?\"\\n\"Is the Astrologer home?\"\\n\"You cannot enter.\"\\n\"I will do so.\"\\n\"I cannot let you.\"\\n\"I must see the Astrologer.\"\\n\"Come later.\"\\n\"I cannot come later; I am in a great hurry.\"\\n\"Hey! You! You fellow! Stop! Stop!\"\\n\"Damn it! Move away! I\\'ll kill you if you stand in the \\nway.\"\\n\"Sir! Sir! Please! Please! Don\\'t enter! Don\\'t go in.\"\\nThe confused shouts came closer, and closer. The wooden \\nfront door opened with a bang.  With all this great \\ncommotion, a young man made a sudden entry.\\nAnother fellow was trying to drag him back by pulling at \\nhis shoulders. The youth shook off the hands, stepped \\nacross the doorway and came into the room.\\nOur readers would have guessed the identity of the \\nnewcomer! Yes, it was our youthful hero, Vandiya Devan. \\nAll the three pairs of eyes inside the house looked at that \\nwarrior.\\nVandiya Devan also looked at the people inside; no; he \\nlooked at only one person inside. Not even that. He did not see even Kundavai Devi completely. He just saw her \\ngolden face. Did he at least see her face completely? -- not \\neven that! He saw the petals of her coral red lips, opening \\nslightly with surprise; he saw her wide open eyes \\nbrimming with mischief, surprise and laughter; he saw the \\ndark eyelashes and eyebrows; he saw the sandal colored \\nforehead; he saw the rosy dimpled cheeks; he saw the \\nthroat shaped like a smooth conch -shell. He saw all these \\nat the same time and individually! They became embossed \\nin his heart.\\nAll this was for just a second . He quickly turned towards \\nthe Astrologer\\'s disciple and said, \"Why man, inside ... \\nWhy didn\\'t you say that these ladies were inside the house? \\nIf you had said it, would I have come in like this?\" With \\nthese words he pushed the man outside and crossed the\\ndoorstep once again. Even then, he turned to look at \\nKundavai once more, before going out.\\n\"Dear me! It seems like the quiet after a raging storm!\" \\nsaid Kundavai Pirati.\\n\"Listen. The storm has not stopped!\" said Vanathi of \\nKodumbalur.\\nThe debate between the Astrologer\\'s disciple and Vandiya \\nDevan was still continuing.\\n\"Sir! Who was that?\" asked Kundavai.\\n\"I do not know, Thaye. Seems like a foreigner; looks as if \\nhe is a rough fellow.\"\\nKundavai suddenly thought of something and laughed \\nbrightly. \"Why are you laughing, Akka?\" asked Vanathi.\\n\"Why am I laughing? We were talking about my \\nbridegroom -- if he would come on horseback, riding an \\nelephant or jump down from the roof; I thought of that and \\nlaughed!\" \\nVanathi was also possessed of an uncontrolla ble laughter \\nnow. Their laughter rose like waves on the ocean shore. \\nBecause of their laughter even the noises of the dispute \\noutside stopped.\\nImmersed in silent thought the Astrologer gave kumkum to \\nboth ladies. After receiving it both women rose and wal ked \\noutside. The Astrologer went along.\\nVandiya Devan who was standing aside near the doorstep, \\nsaw them and said loudly, \"I beg pardon. This genius did \\nnot tell me that you ladies were inside. That is why I \\nentered in such a hurry. Forgive me for that.\"\\nWith a pleasant face and mischief - filled, teasing eyes, \\nKundavai looked up at him once. She did not say a single \\nword in reply. She took hold of Vanathi\\'s hand and walked \\ntowards her chariot under the banyan tree.1\"The women of Kudanthai seem to have no  manners. Can \\nthey not utter even one word in reply to a gentleman who \\naccosts them?\" The words of Vandiya Devan spoken in a \\nloud voice could be heard by everyone.\\nAfter helping them both be seated, the charioteer also \\nclimbed to his perch. The horse draw n chariot moved \\nswiftly towards the banks of River Arisil. Vandiya Devan \\nstood watching till the chariot disappeared from sight.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 12: ' Nandini\\nDon\\'t we have to disclose how Vandiya Devan, whom we \\nhad left in a ferry-boat on the banks of the Kollidam, \\narrived at the doorsteps of the Astrologer of Kudanthai?\\nThe Saiva gentleman, who objected to having Azlvar -\\nadiyan in the boat, turned towards Vandiya Devan and \\nsaid, \"I let this fellow get in because of you, Thambi. \\nHowever, as long as we are in this boat he should not utter \\nthat eight-letter word. If he says it, I shall demand that he \\nbe thrown into this Kollidam! These boatmen are my \\nmen!\"\\n\"Sir! Devout Mr. Nambi! Did thy hallowed ears hear it?\" \\nasked Vandiya Devan.\\n\"If this fellow does not utter the five -letter word, I too shall \\nnot utter the holy-name of eight-letters\" said Nambi.\\n(Note: The eight letter word is the name of Vishnu -- na-\\nmo-sri-na-ra-ya-na-ya -- worshipped by the Vaishnava \\nsect; the five letter word -- na-ma-si-va-ya -- denotes Shiva \\nworshipped by the Saiva sect.)\\n\"Who is this fellow to object to my uttering the five -\\nlettered holy name of the great God Shiva? No! Never! \\nThough you may be bound by chainsand thrown into the deepest seas,Your only companion and hope is the name na-ma-si-va-ya!\"\\nThese words were uttered in a roaring voice by the Saiva \\ngentleman. Upon hearing it, Azlvar -adiyan began singing \\nin a louder voice:\\nI searched, and upon searching foundthe holy name, Na-mo-sri-na-ra-ya-na-ya;\\nSaying the words, \"Siva, Siva, Sivaa!\" the gentleman stuck \\nboth his index fingers into his ears! When Azlvar -adiyan \\nstopped singing, he took his fingers out of his ears.\\nAzlvar-adiyan looked at Vandiya Devan and asked, \\n\"Thambi, you ask that fanatic Saiva fellow. He is in such agony when he merely hears God\\'s name! Does not this \\nriver Kollidam wash the lotus feet of God Narayana who \\nreposes in Srirangam and then come down here? Is it not \\nbecause these waters, which have touched the feet of \\nNarayana, have become hallowed, that Shiva performs \\npenance while immersed in these waters at Thiru -anai-\\nkava?\"\\nBefore he could conclude this long story, the Saiva zealot \\nbecame very furious and rushed towards the equally \\nfanatic Vaishnava Nambi. Since both entered into a  fist \\nfight at one end of the boat, it seemed as if the ferry -boat \\nwould soon capsize! One of the men and Vandiya Devan \\nintervened and separated them.\\n\"Oh, you great and best of devout souls! Both of you seem \\nto have a wish to drown in the floods of this Kollidam and \\ngo directly to paradise! But I have several other \\nengagements left on this beautiful earth,\" said Vandiya \\nDevan with some disgust.\\nOne of the boatmen articulated his opinion, \"I am not sure \\nif one would definitely enter paradise if he falls i nto the \\nKollidam! But, I guarantee that you would enter the \\ninnards of a crocodile! Look over there!\" His finger \\npointed at a big crocodile with its terrorizing, wide open \\njaws.\\n\"I am not one bit scared about those crocodiles. Would he \\nnot come to my aid, Lord Narayana the original God, who \\nsaved the elephant Gajendra from such a crocodile? Where \\nwould he go?\" said Azlvar -adiyan.\\n\"Where would he go? Perhaps he is hiding in the sari -folds \\nof the milkmaids of Brindavan!\"\\n\"Perhaps Shiva is entangled in anot her predicament: just \\nlike that time when, having given boons to the demon \\nBhasma, he was running around with terror; perhaps \\nThirumal has gone to save him from yet another such \\npredicament,\" retorted Nambi. \\nThe fanatic Saiva replied: \"Perhaps this fanati c ignoramus \\ndoes not remember how Vishnu\\'s pride was demolished \\nduring the burning of Tripura?\"\\n\"Why do you argue like this? I don\\'t know! Why don\\'t \\neach of you worship the God to whom you are devoted?\" \\nsaid Vandiya Devan.\\nIt would be appropriate to expl ain to our readers at this \\ntime, why the Saiva devotee and Azlvar -adiyan argued in \\nthis fashion and why there was a similar wordy duel at \\nVeera-narayana-puram.\\nIn the ancient Tamil land, for almost six hundred years, \\n(up till about the tenth century AD) t he religions of \\nBuddhism and Jainism held prestigious sway. Because of \\nthese religions, the Tamil land gained several advantages. \\nSculpture, painting, poetry, literature and other such arts \\nwere nurtured and developed. Emphasis was on Sanskrit. 2Later the Azlvar\\'s (Vaishnava saints) and Nayanmar\\'s \\n(Saiva saints) appeared. They sang melodious poems --\\ndevotional songs in nectar -sweet, divine Tamil. They \\nfostered and developed the Vaishnava (of Vishnu) and \\nSaiva (of Shiva) sects of Hinduism. Their preaching wa s \\nquite powerful. They utilized the power of art, sculpture \\nand music for their missionary work. Several others set \\ntheir songs to divine music and sang them. Those who \\nlistened to these musical poems were enticed, enamored \\nand subject to fanatic devotion.  The Shiva and Vishnu \\ntemple-towns mentioned in such devotional songs acquired \\nnew merit and fresh holiness. Temples, which till then \\nwere built with wood and brick, were renovated and rebuilt \\nwith stone and sculpture. Such holy renovation -works \\nwere undertaken even since Vijayala Chozla\\'s times by the \\nChozla monarchs and members of their family as well as \\nother nobility.\\nAt about the same time an important event occurred in the \\nKerala nation. A great soul was born in the village of \\nKaladi. At a very young  age he gave up worldly pleasures \\nand became an ascetic. He studied all the sciences and \\nliterature in the northern language (Sanskrit) and became \\nan expert. He then established the foundation for the \\nAdvaita philosophy, based on the principles gained from\\nthe Hindu scriptures -- Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavat Gita \\nand Brahma Sutras because of his expertise in Sanskrit. \\nHe, Sankara the Teacher, traveled all over the Indian sub -\\ncontinent and established eight religious -seats for \\npropagating Advaita philosophy. Ascetics who espoused \\nhis philosophy spread his word all over the country. \\n(Advaita meaning non-dual, advocates the non -dual nature \\nof existence; that God is only one; and that God and man \\nare one and the same.)\\nThus, in the Tamil lands, during the times of our story \\n(tenth century AD) there was a great religious revival and \\nawakening. Certain harmful consequences, arising out of \\nthis revival, also spread throughout the countryside. \\nFanatic Shiva devotees and fanatic Vishnu devotees rose \\nhere and there. They entered into fights wherever they met \\neach other. Sometimes, Advaita philosophers also entered \\ninto these disputes. Wordy duels often turned into fistfights \\nand brawls.\\nThere is an interesting story that reveals the extent of this \\nrivalry between the religious sects of those times. A man \\nfrom Srirangam, of the Vaishnava sect, was once walking \\nalong the outer walls of the Shiva temple at Thiru -anai-\\nkava. Suddenly a stone hit his head. He was wounded and \\nbleeding. The Vaishnava man looked up towards the s ky. \\nHe saw a crow sitting atop the old temple tower and \\nsurmised that a piece of brick from the dilapidated spire \\ndislodged by the crow must have fallen on his head. \\nImmediately he forgot his wound and pain and became \\nquite delighted. He said, \"Oh you devo ut Vaishnava crow \\nfrom Srirangam! Good that you are demolishing this Shiva \\ntemple completely!\"In those days, this fanatic rivalry between the Vaishnavas \\nand Saivas was widespread. Knowing about this will be \\nvery helpful to readers who may have the intent ion of \\nreading further chapters in this story.\\nWhen the boat reached the other shore, the Saiva \\ngentleman looked at Azlvar -adiyan and cursed him with \\nthese words: \"May you loose all prosperity and become \\nutterly destitute,\" before he went on his way. \\nThe footman from Kadamboor who had come with \\nVandiya Devan went away towards the nearby village of \\nThiru-panan-thal, saying that he would come back with a \\nmount for him. Azlvar -adiyan and Vandiya Devan sat \\ndown under a large banyan tree on the river bank. Se veral \\nkinds of birds roosting in the thick, leafy branches of that \\nwide-spreading, large tree raised a pleasing musical sound. \\nBoth of them, Devan and Nambi, tried to pry the secrets \\nfrom each other\\'s mouths. For a while they talked of this \\nand that in a round-about fashion.\\n\"Well Thambi, you did go to Kadamboor without taking \\nme with you?\"\\n\"Even my entry into that fortress was fraught with great \\ndifficulty, Mr. Nambi.\"\\n\"Is that so? How did you go in? Perhaps you did not go at \\nall?\"\\n\"I did enter. I did go in. If I make up my mind to do \\nsomething will I take a backward step? The gate -keepers \\nstopped me. I goaded my horse to gallop inside and all the \\nmen obstructing my way fell away in confusion. Before \\nthey could rise and surround me, my friend Kandamaran\\ncame to my rescue and took me inside.\"\\n\"That\\'s what I thought. You are a very courageous fellow! \\nAnd then, what happened? Who else had come there?\"\\n\"All sorts of dignitaries had come. I do not know their \\nnames. Lord Pazluvoor had come. His young bride h ad \\nalso come. Dear me! How shall I describe the beauty of \\nthat lady!\"\\n\"What? Did you see her?!\"\\n\"Yes. Why not? My friend Kandamaran took me to the \\ninner courts of the women. I saw her there. Amidst all \\nthose women, the Young -Queen of Lord Pazluvoor was \\nthe greatest beauty. Among all the dark -colored beauties, \\nthat queen\\'s face shone like a radiant full -moon.  All the \\nheavenly beauties:  Ramba, Urvasi, Tilottama, Indrani, \\nChandrani -- all of them must be mentioned only after \\nher.\"\\n\"Dear me! You describe h er with such rapture! Then, what \\nhappened? Did you see the gypsy dance?\"3\"Yes. It was very captivating. I thought of you at that \\ntime.\"\\n\"I was not fortunate to see it. What happened after that?\"\\n\"The velan attam (oracle -dance) took place. The `divine -\\nman\\' and `divine-woman\\' came upon the stage and danced \\nwith frenzy.\"\\n\"Did the spirit manifest? Did they declare any oracle?\"\\n\"Oh, yes! `All endeavors will be achieved. The rains will \\nbe good; the land will be bountiful,\\' said the soothsayer.\"\\n\"Is that all?\"\\n\"He then said something about political affairs. I did not \\nlisten to that carefully.\"\\n\"Dear, dear me! Is that so? You should have noticed \\nThambi! You are a young man; you seem to be brave and \\ncourageous. If anybody talks about political affairs at any\\nplace, you should listen carefully.\"\\n\"You say the truth. I too felt the same thing this morning.\"\\n\"Why feel so in the morning?\"\\n\"This morning my friend Kandamaran and I talked all \\nalong the way as we rode to the banks of the Kollidam. I \\nbelieve that after I had gone to bed last night, all the \\ndignitaries who were at Kadamboor convened a midnight -\\nmeeting to discuss some important political affairs.\"\\n\"What did they discuss about?\"\\n\"That, I do not know. Kandamaran said something in a \\ncryptic fashion but he did not explain clearly. He said that \\nsome event was to take place very soon and that he would \\nexplain at that time. All his statements were rather \\nmysterious. Why Sir! Do you know anything?\"\\n\"About what?\"\\n\"Everybody in the countryside and city is tal king about it? \\nA comet can be seen in the skies and the empire may be \\nsubject to some grave danger; there may be a change in the \\nChozla monarchy; this and that ... Such talk has been heard \\neven in the Thondai lands. Also, I believe that all sorts of \\nimportant officials meet together quite often, to discuss \\nabout the `Rights to the succession\\' of the Chozla throne. \\nWhat do you think? Who is likely to succeed to the \\nthrone?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know anything about such matters. What \\nconnection do I have with political affairs? I am a devout \\nVaishnava; I am a slave to those who serve the Azlvar \\nsaints; I sing the devotional songs that I know and go from \\none holy place to the other.\" After uttering these words Azlvar -adiyan began singing the \\nfollowing words:\\nI spied upon his golden presence;I saw his divine grace.\\nVandiya Devan interrupted him, \"Let good fortune be \\nyours. Please stop this.\"\\n\"Dear me! You ask me to stop singing these divine Tamil \\npsalms!\"\\n\"Mr. Azlvar-adiyan Nambi! I have a suspicion. Shall I \\ndisclose it?\"\\n\"Please do.\"\\n\"You will not come to beat me up with your wooden -\\nstaff?\"\\n\"You? Is it possible for me to hit you?\"\\n\"I think that all your devotion, your Vaishnava fanaticism, \\nyour psalm singing -- everything is one big deception. I \\nsuspect it to be a big masquerade!\"\\n\"Oh! Oh! What talk is this? Offense! Abuse!\"\\n\"No offense and no forgiveness. You put on such guise to \\nhide your womanizing! I have seen some others like you: \\nwho wander around with an obsession for womankind. \\nWhat you find in such wome n, that I do not know! I seem \\nto dislike any woman I see.\\n\"Thambi, I too know of some men who are crazy about \\nwomen. But don\\'t mix me up with such fellows. I am not a \\nmasquerader. Your suspicions are incorrect.\"\\n\"Then why did you ask me to deliver your n ote to the girl \\nwho came in the palanquin? That too, how can you lose \\nyour heart to a woman who is married to another? Did you \\nnot want to come to Kadamboor mainly to see her? Don\\'t \\ndeny it.\"\\n\"I won\\'t deny it. But your reasoning is not correct. There is \\na much more appropriate justification. It is a long story.\"\\n\"My horse hasn\\'t arrived yet. Tell me that story. I can \\nlisten.\"\\n\"By `story\\' I do not mean an imaginary tale. It happened \\ntruly. An astonishing account. You will be shocked if you \\nhear it. Do you want me to recount it?\"\\n\"If you would like to.\"\\n\"Alright. I shall tell you. I am in a great hurry to go \\nsomeplace else; nonetheless, I will tell you that story \\nbefore I go. I may need your help sometime later. You \\nwon\\'t refuse it then, will you?\"4\"If it is justified I will help you. If you do not like it, don\\'t \\ntell me anything.\"\\n\"No. No. I must surely tell you the story. The young bride \\nof that demon, Lord Pazluvoor, the girl to whom I asked \\nyou to carry a note, her name is Nandini. You will be \\nsurprised if you hear what I have to say about Nandini. \\nYou will wonder if there can be such atrocities in this \\nworld.\" With this preamble, Azlvar -adiyan started \\nnarrating the story of Nandini.\\nAzlvar-adiyan Nambi was born in a village on the banks of \\nthe River Vaigai, in the Pandiya Kingdom. All his family \\nwere ardent Vaishnava devotees.  One day, his father was \\nwalking in the gardens along the river bank when he found \\nan orphan baby girl who was abandoned in the garden. He \\nbrought the infant home. Because the child was very \\nattractive and beautiful, all the members of his family \\nloved and nourished her. Since the child was found in a \\ngarden (nandavan), they named her Nandini. Nambi, \\nconsidering her a younger sister, loved and cherished her. \\nAs Nandini grew in years, her devotion to God Vishnu also \\ngrew. All the people around them believed that she would \\nbecome another Andal (Vaishnava saint) to captivate all \\ntheir hearts. Azlvar-adiyan believed it more than anyone \\nelse. After his father\\'s death, he took up the  responsibility \\nof raising that girl. The two of them travelled from one \\ntown to another, singing Vaishnava poems and spreading \\nthe belief in devotion to Vishnu. People who heard \\nNandini, wearing basil -leaf garlands and singing the \\npsalms of the Azlvar sai nts, were enchanted.\\nAt one time Azlvar-adiyan had to go on a journey to Thiru -\\nvenkadam (Tirupati). His return was delayed. A mishap \\noccurred to Nandini.\\nThe final great-battle between the Chozla and Pandiya \\nkings was fought near Madurai City. The Pandiy a armies \\nwere totally destroyed. King Veera -pandiya had fallen in \\nthe battlefield with wounds all over his body. Some of his \\npersonal servants found him: they tried to revive him and \\nsave his life; they brought him away from the battlefield \\nand into the house of Nandini which was nearby. Nandini, \\nupon seeing the condition of the Pandiya king, was filled \\nwith pity and she nursed him in the sickbed. However, the \\nChozla soldiers soon found this out. They surrounded \\nNandini\\'s house, entered inside and killed Ve era-pandiya. \\nLord Pazluvoor, captivated by the beauty of Nandini \\nwhom he found there, imprisoned her and took her away \\nwith him.\\nAll this happened three years ago. After that Azlvar -adiyan \\ncould not see Nandini at all. From that day, Azlvar -adiyan \\nwas trying to meet and talk to Nandini. If she wished it, he \\nwould free her and take her away. He had not succeeded in \\nthat endeavor so far.Upon hearing this tale, Vandiya Devan\\'s heart was \\ntouched. For a second, he considered telling Nambi that \\nthe person inside the covered palanquin in Kadamboor was \\nnot Nandini; that it was Prince Madurandaka. Something \\nin his heart prevented him. Perhaps all this tale was the \\nfertile imagination of Azlvar -adiyan. Therefore, he did not \\nreveal the secrets he had learned at the Kadamboor \\nfortress. By now they could see the footman from \\nKadamboor coming back, leading a horse.\\n\"Thambi, will you do me one favor?\" asked Azlvar -adiyan.\\n\"How can I help you? Lord Pazluvoor is capable of \\ncontrolling all this Chozla Empire. I am a singl e fellow \\nwith no powers. What can I do?\" Vandiya Devan answered \\nhim carefully. Later he asked, \"Mr. Nambi, are you saying \\nthat you do not know anything about political affairs? Can \\nyou say who is eligible to succeed to the Chozla throne if \\nsomething happens to Sundara Chozla?\" After saying this \\nhe examined Nambi\\'s face eagerly to see if there was any \\nchange in his expression. There was not an iota of change.\\n\"What will I know of such matters, Thambi? Perhaps, if \\nyou ask the Astrologer of Kudanthai, he may be able to tell \\nyou something.\"\\n\"Oh? Is the Astrologer of Kudanthai that capable?\"\\n\"Very capable. He will make predictions based on \\nastrology; he will know your mind and explain the future. \\nHe knows all the worldly activities and will base his \\npredictions accordingly.\"\\nVandiya Devan made up his mind to see the astrologer \\nbefore he went any further! From ancient times humanity \\nis fascinated in finding out about what will happen in its \\nfuture. Princes have this fascination; paupers have it too. \\nThe most learned and knowledgeable have it; the foolish \\nand ignorant ones also do so. There is no surprise about the \\nfact that our youthful hero, Vandiya Devan, who was \\ntravelling upon secret government affairs across cities and \\nnations, had such a fascination.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 13: ' The Waxing Moon\\nThe Astrologer led Vandiya Devan into the house after the \\nchariot carrying the princesses had disappeared from view. \\nHe seated himself on his best seat. He asked the youth who \\nwas looking around to sit dow n and examined him from \\nhead to toe.\\n\"Thambi, who are you? Where have you come?\"\\nVandiya Devan laughed.\\n\"Why are you laughing, my son?\"5\"Nothing. You are such a famous astrologer. You ask me \\nsuch questions! Can you not find out by your astrology \\nabout who I am and why I came here?\"\\n\"Oh! Is that so? I can find out. But if I find out and predict \\nthings on my own behalf, I am wondering who will pay for \\nmy services.\"\\nVandiya Devan smiled and then asked, \"Sir! Those two \\nwho came here before me, who are the y?\"\\n\"Ah! Them? I realize whom you are asking about. I know \\nThambi, I know. Are you not asking about the persons \\nwho were in here when you dragged my disciple and made \\na sudden entry into my house? You are asking about them \\naren\\'t you? Those two, who left in that swift chariot raising \\nthe road dust behind them, you are asking about them?\" \\nsaid the Astrologer in a rambling fashion. \\n\"Yes. Yes. I am asking about them...\"\\n\"OK. Ask. Ask as much as you wish. Who said not to ask? \\nThose two persons were two women!\"\\n\"That was obvious even to me! Sir, I am not blind. I can \\ndifferentiate between men and women. Even if it is a man \\nmasquerading as a woman I can find out.\"\\n\"Then, why did you ask ...\"\\n\"Women means, who are they, what kind? ...\"\\n\"Oh ho! You are askin g about that! According to the \\nscience of beauty, women are classified into four kinds: \\npadmini, chittini, gandarvi, vidyadari. You seem to have \\nsome expertise in the study of beauty! According to that \\nfourfold classification those two women belong to the \\npadmini or gandarvi class.\"\\n\"Oh God!\"\\n\"What, my son?\"\\n\"If I call out to God, why do you answer?\"\\n\"What is wrong in that? Haven\\'t you heard that God is \\neverywhere? It seems that you have not kept company with \\nlearned people. God is in me. God is in you too. My \\ndisciple, whom you dragged inside, God is in him too...\"\\n\"Enough. Enough. Please stop!\"\\n\"God asked me to talk all this time; and now God \\ncommands me to stop!\"\\n\"Sir! Mr. Astrologer, those two women who left just now -\\n- who are they? What is their  family? Where do they come from? What is their name? -- that is what I asked.  If you \\ncan answer me without rambling like this ...\"\\n\"If I answer you, what will you give me, my son?\"\\n\"I shall offer you my thanks gladly.\"\\n\"You can keep the glad offering to yourself. If you are \\nwilling to give some gold offering, let me know.\"\\n\"Will you answer clearly, if I make a gold offering?\"\\n\"I will answer only if an answer is possible. Thambi, listen \\nto this. Several persons will come and go from an \\nastrologer\\'s house. One should not talk about one visitor to \\nanother. I will not tell you anything about the persons who \\nleft just now. Neither will I disclose a single word about \\nyou, to any person who may come later and ask about \\nyou.\"\\n\"Ah! Everything that Azlvar -adiyan Nambi said about you \\nseems to be true!\"\\n\"Azlvar-adiyan? Who is he? A person with that name?\"\\n\"What, don\\'t you know him? He talked as if he knew you \\nvery well. Have you never heard of Azlvar -adiyan \\nNambi?\"\\n\"Perhaps I know the man. Don\\'t remember the n ame. \\nDescribe him a little, let me see.\"\\n\"He is short and squat. He wears his hair in a topknot on \\nhis forehead. He wears his vaetti (loose lower garment of \\nmen) tightly around his young paunch. Making a paste of \\nsandal powder, he wears it in vertical mar ks all over his \\nbody; readily enters into fiery fights with devout Saivas; if \\nhe sees an Advaita philosopher, he raises his wooden staff. \\nSometime ago you said `You are God; I am God.\\' If \\nAzlvar-adiyan had heard it, he would have raised his staff \\nand rushed over to beat you, by saying `God is hitting \\nGod.\\' He ...\"\\n\"Thambi, From what you say, I think you are talking about \\nThirumalai.\"\\n\"Does he go by other names like that?\"\\n\"That fanatic Vaishnava has a different name in different \\ntowns.\"\\n\"Does he also disguise himself in different garbs for \\ndifferent persons?\"\\n\"Oh yes! He will put on masquerades appropriate for the \\noccasion and time.\"\\n\"Will everything he utters be mixed with fancy and \\nfalsehood?\"6\"About seven eighths of what he says will be full of \\nimagination. The rest may be gospel truth.\"\\n\"So, you say that he is a very wicked fellow.\"\\n\"One cannot say that! He is good to the good; bad to the \\nwicked.\"\\n\"That means we cannot trust his words and do anything.\"\\n\"Believing or not believing depends on th e words uttered.\"\\n\"For example, he said that if I come to you and asked you \\nfor astrological predictions, you will give expert \\nanswers...\"\\n\"Did I not say that about one eighth of his speech will be \\ngospel truth? That statement belongs to that category!\"\\n\"Then predict something for me by your astrology; foretell \\nsomething. It is getting late and I have to go in a hurry.\"\\n\"Where do you have to go in such a great hurry, my son?\"\\n\"Can you not reveal that also from your astrology? Where \\nshould I go? Where should I not go? If I do go, will my \\nendeavor be successful? -- I came to ask you all these \\nthings.\"\\n\"I need some basis to foretell or predict by my astrology; I \\nneed a horoscope to study; if there is no horoscope, I must \\nat least know the day and star und er which you were born. \\nIf you do not know even that, I need a name and address.\"\\n\"My name is Vallavarayan.\"\\n\"Aha! Of the Vaanar clan?\"\\n\"Yes I am that very same Vandiya Devan Vallavarayan.\"\\n\"Say it like that! Thambi why did you not say this before?  \\nI think, I even have your horoscope with me. If I search for \\nit I can find it.\"\\n\"How is that Sir?\"\\n\"What other occupation do astrologer\\'s like me have? We \\ncollect the horoscopes of men and women born in noble \\nfamilies...\"\\n\"I am not from any such famous no ble family.\"\\n\"How can you say that? Do you not know of the fame and \\nprestige of your clan? How many poets have sung the \\npraises of the Vaanar clan in how many poems? Perhaps \\nyou have not heard the poems?\"\\n\"Recite one such poem. Let me hear it.\"The Astrologer immediately sang the following poem:\\nAre there lips that do not speak of your fame: oh noble Vaana?Are there chests that do not have your name tattooed on: oh brave Vaana?Are there flagpoles that do not bear thy colors: oh victorious Vaana?Are there domains that stand beyond your survey: oh majestic Vaana?\\nWhen he sang, it was quite obvious that the Astrologer was \\nnot a musical expert. Nevertheless, he sang the poem \\nclearly and with involvement.\\n\"How is the poem?\" he asked.\\n\"The poem is pleasing to the ear! But now, I have to tie my \\ncolors to the horns of some bull! I have to stand atop the \\nbranches of a banyan tree to survey my domain. Even that \\nis doubtful. My weight might break the branch and throw \\nme down!\" said Vandiya Devan.\\n\"Today your situation is like that. How do we know what \\ncan happen tomorrow?\"\\n\"I thought that you might know; that is why I came here.\"\\n\"What can I know Thambi? Like everybody I am a short \\nlived human being. But the planets and stars foretell the \\nfuture. I have learned to understand a little of what they \\nsay and then explain it to those who seek me.\"\\n\"What do the planets and stars foretell about me, Mr. \\nAstrologer?\"\\n\"They foretell that you will grow day by day.\"\\n\"Dear me! That is pretty good! The height that I hav e now \\nis itself quite too much. I had to bend low as I entered your \\nhouse! What can I do if I grow taller? There is no use of \\nsuch generalities. Say something specific.\"\\n\"If you ask me about something particular, I can answer \\nmore specifically.\"\\n\"Tell me, the enterprise on which I am going to Tanjore, \\nwill it succeed?\"\\n\"If you are going to Tanjore on your own behalf the \\nendeavor will succeed; if you are going on someone else\\'s \\nbehalf, I have to see that persons horoscope before I \\nanswer.\"\\nVandiya Devan shook his head in astonishment and placed \\na finger upon his nose. \"Sir, I have never encountered as \\nastute a fellow as you.\"\\n\"Do not flatter me, Thambi.\"\\n\"Ok. I shall ask what I want clearly. I wish to meet the \\nEmperor in Tanjore. Is that possible?\"7\"There are two astrologers greater than me in Tanjore. You \\nhave to ask them.\"\\n\"Who are they?\"\\n\"One is the Elder Lord Pazluvoor; the other is his brother \\nthe Younger Lord Pazluvoor.\"\\n\"It is said that the health of the Emperor is in a bad state. Is \\nthat true?\"\\n\"People will say all sorts of things. Why not? Don\\'t believe \\nall that they say; neither should you repeat such things.\"\\n\"Can you tell me who has the right to succeed to the \\nChozla throne if something happens to the Emperor?\"\\n\"That throne is not for y ou nor for me. Why should we \\nbother about it?\"\\n\"From that fate we are saved!\" said Vandiya Devan.\\n\"It is true Thambi. The rights of succession to an empire is \\nnot an ordinary matter. It is a very dangerous topic. Is that \\nnot so?\"\\n\"Sir! At present the Prince who is in Kanchi, the Crown \\nPrince Aditya Karikala...\"\\n\"Yes he is there; you have come on his behalf. Haven\\'t \\nyou?\"\\n\"You have found that out in the end; no harm done. What \\nabout his fortune?\"\\n\"I don\\'t have his horoscope in my hands now Thambi. I \\nhave to study it.\"\\n\"What about the fortunes of Prince Madurandaka?\"\\n\"His, is a peculiar fortune; similar to that of womenfolk. \\nHis fortunes are always subject to the power of others.\"\\n\"Even now people say that the Chozla Empire is under \\nWomen\\'s Rule. They say that it is worse than the rule of \\nthe Queen Alli?\"\\n\"Thambi, where do they say such things?\"\\n\"To the north of the Kollidam.\"\\n\"Maybe they are talking about the power of the new bride \\nmarried by the Elder Lord Pazluvoor.\"\\n\"I heard differently.\"\\n\"What did you hear?\"\\n\"They said that the beloved daughter of the Emperor, the \\nYounger Pirati Kundavai, is the one ruling like that.\" The Astrologer peered into Vandiya Devan\\'s face \\ncarefully. He tried to read the face to find out if he was \\nsaying these words after recognizing Kundavai, who had \\nleft his house a little earlier. There was no sign to support \\nthe doubt.\\n\"Totally wrong Thambi. Emperor Sundara Chozla is in \\nTanjore. Kundavai Pirati lives in Pazlayarai. Moreover ...\"\\n\"Moreover what? Why did you sto p?\\n\"During the daytime one must look in all four directions \\nbefore speaking; at nighttime not even that. But, there is \\nnothing wrong in telling you, I think. What power or \\ninfluence does the Emperor have these days? All the \\nauthority is held by the Lords of Pazluvoor.\" After saying \\nthis the Astrologer examined Vandiya Devan\\'s face once \\nagain.\\n\"Sir! I am not a spy of the Lords of Pazluvoor. You do not \\nhave to suspect me of that! A little while ago you talked \\nabout the impermanence of kingdoms and royal dyn asties. \\nYou gave me the example of my own Vaanar clan. Please \\ntell me the truth. How is the future of the Chozla \\nDynasty?\"\\n\"I can tell truthfully without any uncertainty. Towards the \\nend of spring the River Cauvery and its tributaries will be \\nfilled with new floods. The people living on the river \\nbanks know very well that it is a flood that will rise day by \\nday. Till the beginning of the summer months the flood \\nwill keep rising. By the autumn months the waters start \\nreceding. The people living along the ba nk realize it to be \\na ebbing flood. The Chozla Empire is now like the fresh \\nflood of springtime that grows day by day. For several \\nmore hundreds of years it will grow and spread. The \\nChozla Empire is now a Waxing Moon. The day of the \\nFull Moon is far away.  Therefore the Chozla power will \\nexpand more and more.\"\\n\"After talking all this time, you have said one thing \\nexplicitly! Thanks! If possible, just tell me one more thing. \\nI have a great desire to go on a ship and travel to distant \\nlands...\"\\n\"That wish will definitely be fulfilled. You have the \\nfortune of the wheel. You will be travelling constantly, as \\nif you have wheels on your feet. You will go by walk; ride \\nupon horses; go on elephants and you will also travel \\naboard ships. You have the fortune to go on a sea voyage \\nvery soon.\"\\n\"Sir, about the Commander of the Southern Armies, Prince \\nArulmozli Varma who is now conducting a campaign in \\nLanka -- what do the planets and stars say about him?\"\\n\"Thambi, those travelling by ship use an instrument made \\nof the magnetic stone to find their directions. Lighthouses \\nalso help these sailors. But do you know what aids the ship 8in the midst of the wide open seas? What is the constant \\nfriend of the sailors? It is the pole star seen in the low \\nnorthern skies. The other  stars and planets all keep moving \\nfrom their positions. Even the group of the `seven seers\\' \\n(little dipper) travels in a circle. But the pole star is never \\nshaken from its fixed position. The younger son of the \\nEmperor, Prince Arulmozli, is like that pole  star. He has \\nthe firmness of mind unshaken by anything. In addition to \\nthe virtues of selflessness and morality, he possess the \\ngoodness of bravery and chivalry. He excels in worldly \\nknowledge as much as in learning. He has a charming face, \\nlike that of a young babe which  calms the aches of those \\nwho gaze upon it. He is the darling son of the angel of \\ngood luck. Just as sailors take direction from the pole star, \\nit will be very useful, if youths like you who embark on the \\nadventure of life, take direction  from Prince Arulmozli.\"\\n\"Dear me! What is all this that you describe about Prince \\nArulmozli? It appears like a lover describing his beloved?\"\\n\"Thambi, if you ask any fellow of the Chozla country on \\nthe banks of the River Ponni, he will say the same.\"\\n\"Many thanks Mr. Astrologer. If the need arises I shall \\nfollow your advice.\"\\n\"Because I saw that your lucky planets are also on the rise, \\nI said this.\" \\n\"I shall take leave of you Sir!  Along with my heartfelt \\nthanks, offered gladly, please accept this sm all tribute of \\ngold offered to you.\"  Saying this, Vandiya Devan placed \\nfive gold coins in the palms of the Astrologer.\\n\"The benevolence of the Vaanar clan has not died even \\nnow!\" said the Astrologer as he hid the coins in his \\nwaistband.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 14: ' A Crocodile On The River Bank\\nIn those days, those who wished to reach Tanjore from \\nKudanthai, travelled along the banks of the rivers Arisil or \\nCauvery and reached the town of Thiru -vai-aru. From \\nthere, they would turn south to go t owards Tanjore. \\nConvenient ferrys or fords to cross the rivers Kudamuruti, \\nVettar, Vennar and Vadavar were available only along that \\nroute.  Vandiya Devan who started from Kudanthai, first \\nwent towards the banks of River Arisil. The sights that he \\nsaw along the way astonished him, being more exquisite \\nthan what he had heard about the Chozla countryside. Any \\nbeautiful sight appears more striking when it is viewed for \\nthe first time!\\nEmerald green rice fields, gardens of ginger and turmeric, \\nplantations of sugarcane and banana, groves of tender coconut palms; streams, rivulets and brooks; tanks, pools \\nand canals; all these made a mosaic of the landscape. \\nWater-lilies bloomed in profusion in the creeks; Lotus and \\nblue-lily were in riotous display on still -water ponds and \\npools. The large red-,  white-, and blue-lotus flowers \\ndazzled his eyes. He had never seen such flowers before! \\nWhite storks and herons flew in large groups like soft \\nclouds. Red-legged cranes stood on one leg and performed \\npenance. Crystal clear water rushed frothing along \\nconduits. Farmers ploughed their rice paddies --  muddy \\nfields, darkened with good fertilizer and rotting leaves --\\neven deeper. Women transplanted seedlings in the well \\ntilled fields. As they were bent on their task they san g \\npleasant folk-songs.\\nSugar mills were established next to the cane plantations. \\nThey fed the mature, dark cane of the previous year\\'s \\nharvest into those mills and extracted sweet -juice. The \\naroma of the fresh juice and boiling molasses being made \\ninto sugar-candy and jaggery filled the air and tingled the \\nnose.\\nSmall cottages with roofs thatched with coconut palm -\\nleaves and houses with tiled roofs were found amidst the \\npalm groves. In the villages, they had cleaned the streets \\nand front porches to a mir ror brightness and decorated \\nthem with beautiful drawings of rice -powder. On some \\nfront porches they had spread the new paddy to dry in the \\nhot sun. Hens and roosters came and pecked at the grain \\nand ran hither and thither with cries of \"Koko ro ko, koko \\nro koro!\" The little girls set to guard the grain did not seem \\nto bother: `How much grain can the tiny hens eat?\\' - they \\nthought in disdain as they continued with their board \\ngames with cowrie shells. \\nThe smells and smoke of cooking rose from chimneys on \\nrooftops. The fragrance of paddy being cured, millet -grain \\nbeing parched, and meat being roasted mingled with each \\nother. Such smells made Vallavarayan\\'s mouth water.\\nBlacksmiths had their shops along the roadside. The fires \\nin such smithies burned bright  with glowing embers. The \\nsound of hammers striking iron could be heard loudly. The \\nsmithies were filled with implements essential to farming, \\nsuch as plough-share points, wheel-pins, shovels, hoes and \\nrakes as well as sharpened spears, lances, swords and \\nshields; farmers and soldiers vied with each other to buy \\nthese instruments of their trade. \\nSmall temples could be spied in the midst of tiny villages. \\nThe sound of drums being beaten and pipes being played \\ninside the temples mingled with the pleasant mu sic of \\nreligious chanting and singing of devotional poems like \\nThevaram. \\nPriests carried the guardian deities of the village, like \\nMariamman, on little cots and pots balanced on their \\nheads; they danced the Karagam in tune to the beat of little \\nudukku drums held in their hands as they sought alms of \\ngrain and produce. 9Men, tired of their work behind the ploughs, rested beneath \\nshady, wide spreading mango trees. They entertained \\nthemselves by setting sharp horned goats to fight each \\nother. \\nPea-hens roosting on housetops called out to their mates in \\na shrill voice; the pea-cocks lifted their long, beautiful tails \\nwith difficulty and flew up to them majestically. Turtle -\\ndoves shook their heads and danced with cooing sounds. \\nThe parrots and cuckoos -- poor creatures shut up in cages \\n-- sang sweetly.\\nVandiya Devan rode upon his horse rather slowly, \\nenjoying such scenes. His eyes had plenty to occupy them. \\nHis heart also enjoyed all the sights. But his inner mind \\ndwelt upon the picture of a girl, covered in mist. \\nAha! Why didn\\'t that girl open her reddened lips and utter \\na few words? What would she have lost by uttering a few \\nsentences? Who could she be? Whoever she is, shouldn\\'t \\nshe have some manners? Do I seem like a fellow to be \\nignored? -- That wily old astrologer never did reveal who \\nthat girl was! He is clever; very clever. How he measures \\nthe depth of one\\'s heart! Such experienced words he utters! \\nOf course he did not predict anything sensible or specific. \\nAbout political affairs ... he escaped withou t disclosing \\nanything! He merely repeated things known to everybody \\nin a fascinating manner. But he did make the good \\nprediction about my lucky -stars being on the rise ... Let the \\nastrologer of Kudanthai prosper in his trade.\\nVandiya Devan rode onwards wi th such thoughts \\noccupying his mind. The sights presented to him, dragged \\nhim off and on from this dream world to reality. Finally he \\nreached the banks of the River Arisil. After going a few \\nyards he heard the sound of women laughing and the jingle \\njangle of their bracelets. \\nThe women were completely hidden by the thick groves of \\ntrees growing on the bank. He peered into the trees, trying \\nto locate the women who made the noise. Suddenly he \\ncould hear the fear filled screams \"Oh dear\", \"Ai Oh\", \\n\"Help\", \"Crocodile!\" said the voices of several women. He \\nwhipped his horse in the direction of the shouts. He soon \\nspied several maids in a clearing between the trees close to \\nthe water. Their faces were filled with fright. But, --\\nsurprise of surprises -- two of them seemed to be the very \\nsame women he had seen in the astrologer\\'s house! \\nVandiya Devan recognized all this within the fraction of a \\nsecond.\\nThat was not all.  A horrible crocodile opening its jaws \\nwide, could be seen at the foot of a thick tree trunk, \\nblending with the roots, half in the water and half on the \\nbank. He had recently seen one such fearful crocodile in \\nthe floods of the Kollidam. He had heard how dangerous \\nthe beast was. Therefore, when he saw the reptile, his heart \\nskipped a beat and his wh ole body froze with agitation for \\na minute. The crocodile was very near the girls who had been \\nlaughing merrily a few moments earlier. It was opening its \\nhorrible jaws wide and appeared monstrous. The crocodile \\nhad to only move just one step closer; one of the girls \\nwould be gone! She could not escape because of the thick \\ntree!\\nHowever confused his heart and mind, there was nothing \\nwrong with his courage. He did not even think beyond one \\nsecond about what he should do. He took careful aim and \\nswiftly threw the spear in his hand. The spear pierced the \\ncrocodile\\'s back, entered deep into its hide and stood \\nupright. Our hero, immediately jumped off his horse and \\ndrawing his sword he rushed towards the reptile to  finish \\nit off in one stroke. \\nHe heard the girls laughing once again, like before. The \\nsound was repulsive to Vandiya Devan\\'s ears. Why do \\nthese foolish women laugh like this at this dangerous \\nmoment? he thought. \\nHaving rushed forward, he stopped in shock and surprise \\nfor a minute. He saw the face s of those women. He could \\nsee no fear or fright in them. He could just detect the signs \\nof laughter and mischief. He could not believe that they \\nwere the same girls who cried out for help a few minutes \\nago. \\nOne among them -- the maid he had seen in the astrologer\\'s \\nhouse -- spoke in a pleasant, elegant voice: \"Girls, stop it! \\nWhy are you all laughing?\" He heard her scolding as if in a \\ndream.\\nHe moved closer to the crocodile and then hesitated as he \\nraised his sword. He turned to look at the faces of tho se \\ngirls once again. A suspicion, which filled his heart with \\nshame, humiliating his very existence -- rose in him.\\nBy now, that girl -- the lady who had dwelt in his thoughts \\nfor some time now -- parted from her friends and came \\nforward. She stood before  him, in front of the crocodile, as \\nif guarding it!\\n\"Sir! I am very thankful to you. Please do not trouble \\nyourself unnecessarily,\"  she said.\\n***** \\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 15: ' Vanathi\\'s Tricks\\nWe request our readers to please recall that earlier mom ent \\nin our story when Kundavai and Vanathi climbed onto the \\nchariot and rode towards Kudanthai, leaving their friends \\non the banks of the River Arisil. We shall now listen to the \\nconversation of those maids who were left behind.0\"My dear Tarika, look at t his good fortune that has blown \\nthe way of that Kodumbalur female! What is so fascinating \\nabout her for our Younger Pirati?\"\\n\"No fascination, no nothing! For the past four months that \\ngirl has been going around like one deranged; she is often \\nfalling down in one of her fainting fits. The Younger Pirati \\nis worried because they have left that orphan girl in her \\ncare.  She is taking Vanathi to the Astrologer to find out \\nwhat ails her. Perhaps it is because of some ghost or spirit? \\nIf it is so, don\\'t they have  to get rid of it with some magic \\nor spell?\"\\n\"It is no ghost and no phantom. Which spirit will come and \\nposses her? She is capable of driving away a hundred \\nghosts.\" A girl known as Varini uttered these words with \\nsome venom.\\n\"All those fainting fits of Vanathi are one big deception \\nmy dear. That snake thinks that she can capture the Prince \\nin her coils if she does such things.\"\\n\"What Niravati says is true. And that is not the whole \\nstory. Remember that day when the Prince was leaving on \\nhis campaign she dropped the platter with the lighted \\nlamp? Even that, she did mainly to attract the attention of \\nthe Prince. How can a platter carried in both hands slip like \\nthat? Or is our Prince some sort of fearsome tiger or bear \\nfor her to be frightened?\" continued Varini.\\n\"And she pretended to fall into a faint immediately; How \\nclever.\"\\n\"More than all her tricks, the funny thing is that Kundavai \\nPirati and the Prince believed her!\" added Sendiru.\\nMandakini offered the comment, \"These are times for \\nthose who deceive and tell lies and falsehoods.\"\\n\"The Prince who had already mounted his horse, leaving \\nfor the campaign; he came back into the palace to look at \\nher!

There is \\nnone in the fourteen known worlds to compare with him. \\nThere is none like him even in the imaginary tales and \\nepics. But what I say is something else.

Varini then whispered something in her friend\\'s \\nears. Niravati intervened, \"Hey! What\\'s the secret? Let us \\nknow it too!\"\\n\"I believe it is not an ordinary fainting fit! It is a lovelorn \\nfit!\" Upon hearing these words all the girls laughed merrily. Hearing this noise, the birds upon the trees flew \\nout with noisy wing-beats. \\n\"When our Prince comes back from Lanka she will again \\ntry her magic tricks on him. We should not give place for \\nthat.\"\\n\"If this Vanathi does not go mad by the time the Prince \\nreturns, I shall change my name from Tarika to Tataka (an \\nogress of the epic Ramayana).\"\\n\"OK! Let it go! Don\\'t we have to complete the task \\nassigned to us before the Younger Pirati comes back? \\nCome girls, enough of this,\" said Mandakini.\\nAfter that, two of them removed one of the loose planks at \\nthe bottom of the barge. In a long alcove under it, they \\nfound a crocodile! That is, a dead crocodile preserved and \\nstuffed with fibre and cotton! They took it out. The girls \\nthen paddled the barge a little way along the bank and \\npulled in near a clearing; a large mango tree g rew along \\nthe bank with thick spreading roots. They pulled the \\nstuffed crocodile amidst the tree roots. It lay among the \\nroots, half in the water and half out. The girls bound a thin \\nstring to one of its legs and tied it to the root, preventing \\nthe stuffed reptile from floating away!\\nTarika asked, \"Why did the Younger Pirati want us to \\nleave the crocodile here, like this?\"\\n\"Don\\'t you know? Vanathi is so timid and poor -spirited, \\nfrightened of each and everything. To get rid of her fear \\nand make her brave.\"\\n\"If we consider all these things, it seems as if the Younger \\nPirati really intends to wed this foolish Vanathi to our \\nPrince!\" exclaimed Niravati. \\n\"If anything like that happens, I shall poison this Vanathi \\nand kill her,\" said the jealous maid, Varini.\\n\"All this jealousy of yours is not warranted.

All of us should polish our charms and \\nshow our competence. What this Vanathi can do, we can \\nalso achieve!\"\\nLet us now explain the reason for such talk amongst these \\nwomen.\\n*****1Ponniyin Selvan\\n', 16: ' Arulmozli Varma\\nAbout a thousand and more years ago, the best of kings, \\nParanthaka Sundara Chozla (AD 957 -973), ruled as an \\nEmperor without equal in South India. He had ascended \\nthe Chozla throne several years before the times of our \\nstory. For the past several hundred years Chozla power had \\nbeen growing. Chozla Territories were spreading in all \\ndirections. Even so, when Sundara Chozla ascended the \\nthrone, his enemies in the south and north were powerful. \\nGandara Aditya who had ruled before him, w as immersed \\nin devotion to God Shiva; he had merited the title \\nGandara-aditya who had knowledge of (knew) Shiva. He \\ndid not show much interest in expanding his territories. \\nAfter Gandara Aditya, his brother Arinjaya, who ascended \\nthe throne, ruled for a sh ort year. After Arinjaya\\'s death at \\nAtrur, his son Paranthaka Sundara Chozla came to power.\\nSundara Chozla had all the qualities essential for a great \\nking. Being skilled in war, he led a campaign to the \\nsouthern region in the very beginning of his reign.   A great \\nbattle took place between the Chozla and Pandiya armies \\nat a place called Chevoor. Mahinda, the King of Lanka, \\nhad sent a large battalion to help his friend Veera -pandiya, \\nwho ruled at that time from Madurai City. The large \\nChozla armies defeated  the combined forces of the \\nPandiyas and the Lankans at Chevoor. Veera -pandiya who \\nlost his armies, lost his crown, lost his friends, saved his \\nlife and ran from the battlefield to escape into hiding. He \\nhid himself in the rocky caves of a desert and bided  his \\ntime.\\nMost of the Lankan army was destroyed in the Chevoor \\nbattle. Some soldiers who survived, abandoned their fame \\nand bravery and escaped to Lanka with their lives.\\nIt had been the practice of the Lankan kings to send their \\nmen in support of the P andiya kings, in the clashes \\nbetween the Chozlas and Pandiyas. Sundara Chozla \\nwished to put an end to this practice. He decided to send a \\nChozla contingent to land in Lanka and teach the island \\nking a lesson. He sent a large army to Lanka under the \\ncommand of a chieftain of Kodumbalur, known as \\nParanthaka the Younger Lord of Velir. Unfortunately the \\nChozla army did not land in Lanka all at one time. They \\ndid not have adequate shipping facilities for that. \\nThe battalions which had landed first started adva ncing \\nwithout any forethought. Mahinda\\'s Lankan army led by \\nCommander Sena came out and surrounded the Chozla \\nforces in a surprise move. A terrible battle was fought. In \\nthat engagement, the Chozla Commander lost his life. \\nStone inscriptions (deciphered in  recent years) refer to him \\nas the Younger Lord of Velir who fell in Lanka.When Veera-pandiya who was hiding in the desert caves, \\nheard this news, he gathered courage once again and \\nemerged. Again he assembled a large army and entered the \\nbattlefield. This time, the Pandiya legion was completely \\ndestroyed. Veera-pandiya also lost his life. Aditya \\nKarikala, the elder son of Sundara Chozla, took part in this \\nfinal battle and performed various heroic deeds. He also \\nacquired the title `The Valiant Prince who wrung the head \\nof Veera-pandiya.\\'\\nIn spite of all this, the Chozla Emperor and all his generals, \\nadvisors, ministers and soldiers, did not forget their wish to \\nteach the Singhala King Mahinda of Lanka a lesson. A \\nlarge force was gathered in readiness for the campaign. \\nThe question \"Who should lead this legion?\" arose. The \\nCrown Prince Aditya Karikala - Sundara Chozla\\'s elder \\nson -- was at that time busy with his troops in the northern \\nborder. He had captured the ancient city of Kanchi, after \\nrouting the armies of the Rashtrakutas who had occupied \\nthe Thiru-munai-padi and Thondai Territories. He was \\nmaking preparations to lead his armies further north.\\nIn this situation, a fierce competition rose among the other \\ngenerals in the Chozla nation for the privile ge of leading \\nthe Lankan campaign. Jealousy and accusations resulted \\nfrom such rivalry. It was very rare to find someone who \\ndid not wish to enter the battlefield in that ancient Tamil \\nland! The competition was about who should go to the \\nwar-front. Enmity and envy would often result from such \\ncompetition.\\nThere was fierce rivalry amongst the Chozla generals \\nabout who should lead the Lankan campaign and establish \\nthe Chozla fame by destroying the pride of the Singhala \\nKings. Prince Arulmozli Varma, the youn ger son of \\nEmperor Sundara Chozla, came forward to put an end to \\nthis rivalry. \"Father! I have spent enough time in the \\nluxury of the Pazlayarai Palace, as the darling child of my \\naunts, grandmothers and mothers. Please appoint me as the \\nCommander of the Southern Armies. I shall go to Lanka \\nand lead the Lankan campaign,\" said the young Prince.\\nArulmozli Varma was barely nineteen years old at that \\ntime. He was Sundara Chozla\\'s cherished younger son; he \\nwas the beloved child of all the queens who lived at th e \\nPazlayarai Palace; he was the darling of the Chozla nation.\\nSundara Chozla was possessed of a handsome \\ncountenance. His father Arinjaya had fallen in love with \\nher beauty and married Kalyani, Princess of the enemy \\nkings of Vaithumba. The son born to Ari njaya and Kalyani \\nwas named Paranthaka; however, the citizens and \\ncountrymen of the Chozla nation who saw the handsome \\nface of the Prince called him Sundara Chozla (sundara \\nmeaning beautiful.) He came to be known by this name.\\nAll the children born to thi s handsome Prince were \\nattractive and beautiful. But the youngest child, Arulmozli, \\nsurpassed all others in beauty. The charm of his handsome \\nface was not of this world; it seemed to be divine! When 2he was a baby, the queens of the Chozla palace would \\nrepeatedly kiss his cheeks and make them flush. More than \\nany other person, his elder sister Kundavai cherished him. \\nThough she was barely two years older to him, Kundavai \\nfelt that the responsibility of rearing this divine child was \\nhers! In his turn, Arulmoz li returned all the love and \\nadoration that his sister showered upon him. The brother \\nwould not cross the line drawn by his elder sister. The \\nYounger Pirati had to merely utter one word; even if all the \\nthree great Gods - Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva came \\ntogether and said something against that, Arulmozli would \\nnot consider their words. The elder sister\\'s words were \\ngospel to the younger brother.\\nThe sister would often peer into her darling brother\\'s face. \\nNot just when he was awake; she would gaze upon the f ace \\nof her sleeping brother for hours together. There is some \\ndivine grace in this boy; It is my duty to bring it to the \\nforefront and make it shine! thought the young Princess. \\nWhen her brother slept, she would often pick up his hands \\nand study the lines on his palms. To her, those lines would \\nappear to have the sign of the Conch and Discus. Aha! He \\nis born to rule this world! He will bring the whole world \\nunder one rule, she would think.  But, there was no \\npossibility of his ascending the Chozla throne. P rinces \\nelder to him -- eligible to ascend the throne -- there were \\ntwo others before him. Then, how could he acquire a \\nkingdom? On which throne could he sit?  Who knows \\ndivine intentions? The world is big; several kingdoms and \\nterritories exist on this ear th. Have we not heard of princes \\nand kings who ventured into alien lands and by their \\nprowess acquired kingdoms? Have we not read of such \\nhappenings in novels and epics? That ancient prince who \\nwas thrown out of his kingdoms on the banks of the \\nGanga, did he not sail the seas to reach Lanka and \\nestablish a mighty nation? Didn\\'t his Singhala Dynasty rule \\nfirmly in Lanka for a thousand years?\\nKundavai thought of such things constantly. In the end she \\ncame to the conclusion that her younger brother was the \\nappropriate commander to lead the Lankan campaign.\\nShe said, \"Thambi, my darling brother Arulmozli! It will \\nbe difficult for me to part from you for even one second. \\nHowever, the time has come for me to send you on your \\nway. You must lead the Lankan campaig n and leave for \\nthe island.\"\\nArulmozli agreed joyously. He had waited for the day -- to \\nescape from the life of luxury and the smothering love of \\nthe maids and queens in the palace. His beloved sister had \\nnow ordered him to do so. What other worry could h e \\nhave? What other impediment?\\nIf Kundavai had made up her mind, there was nothing that \\nwould not take place in the Chozla nation. The Emperor \\nloved his beloved daughter to that extant! He trusted her \\nimplicitly!Prince Arulmozli was appointed the Comman der of the \\nSouthern Armies. He led his men into Lanka, and \\nconducted the campaign for some time. But the war would \\nnot end easily. There was a difference in his method of \\ncampaigning and that of others. Supplies and support \\nrequested by him did not come fr om his native land. \\nTherefore, once in the midst of all his endeavors he came \\nback to Tanjore. He spoke to his father and arranged \\nmatters to his satisfaction. He prepared to depart for Lanka \\nonce again.\\nKundavai had arranged for several auspicious ceremo nies \\nat the main palace in Pazlayarai, to bid farewell to her \\ndarling brother. When Arulmozli stepped out, the victory \\ndrums in the palace courtyard boomed; conches were \\nblown; kettle-drums beaten loudly. Cheering shouts rose \\nsky-high.\\nAll the royal ladies of the Chozla clan blessed their \\nbeloved Prince; they anointed his forehead with holy \\nashes, and warding off evil eyes, sent him on his victorious \\njourney.\\nAll the maids-of-honor in Kundavai\\'s court stood on the \\npalace steps carrying golden patters lade n with a lighted \\nlamp. These maids were no ordinary folk. They were from \\nthe famous noble families of the south. They had come to \\nPazlayarai, considering it a great opportunity, to serve the \\nElder Pirati Sembiyan Madevi and to become companions \\nto Kundavai Pirati. Vanathi, a daughter of the Kodumbalur \\nchieftain, the Younger Lord of Velir, was one among \\nthem.\\nWhen those girls saw the Prince coming down the palace \\nsteps, all of them felt a certain agitation in their hearts. \\nWhen the Prince came closer, they waved their platters \\nwith the lighted lamp before him (to ward off the evil eye). \\nAt that moment Vanathi felt her whole body shiver.\\nThe golden platter in her hands slipped and fell with a \\n\"clang\" to the ground. The thought, \"Oh dear! What is this \\nill omen!\" rose in every mind.  But when they saw the \\nwick burning bright even if the lamp had fallen, they felt it \\nwas after all a good omen. The elders assured them, \"This \\nis a good sign.\"\\nPrince Arulmozli smiled at the girl who had dropped the \\nplate for no apparent reason and continued his descent \\ndown the steps. As soon as he moved ahead, Vanathi fell \\ndown in a swoon. She had fainted with the mortification of \\nhaving committed such an impropriety. Upon the orders of \\nKundavai, the serving maids carried her into  the palace.  \\nKundavai hurried inside, without even waiting to see her \\nbeloved brother mount his horse and depart; she went in, to \\nrevive her friend. \\nHolding the reins of his horse, the Prince who had seen the \\ngirl faint, sent his footman inside to find out \"How is the \\ngirl who fainted?\"3Kundavai sent the footman back with the words \"Tell the \\nPrince to come back here for a minute.\" The brother who \\nhad never crossed the commands of his sister, came back \\naccordingly. The sight of his sister trying to reviv e the \\nyoung girl lying on her lap touched his heart.\\n\"Akka! Who is this girl? What is her name?\" he asked.\\n\"She is the daughter of the Younger Lord Velir of \\nKodumbalur. Her name is Vanathi; of a timid disposition.\"\\n\"Oh! Now I understand why she fainted.  Was it not her \\nfather who led the earlier campaign to Lanka? Didn\\'t he \\ndie in the battlefront over there? Perhaps she remembered \\nthat.\"\\n\"Maybe. But don\\'t worry about her. I can look after her. I \\ncalled you back to wish you well. Go to Lanka and come \\nback victorious and soon. Send me news as often as you \\ncan!\" said the Younger Pirati.\\n\"Fine! You too send me news if anything happens here.\"\\nBy now, Vanathi was regaining consciousness; perhaps \\ndue to the pleasant sound of Prince Arulmozli\\'s voice! Her \\neyelids opened softly. Upon glimpsing the Prince, her eyes \\nopened wider. Her face gained some color and revived; \\ncoral red lips smiled; cheeks dimpled.\\nAlong with her senses a shyness also returned. She sat up \\nquickly. She was mortified upon seeing the Princes s \\nbehind her. She recalled everything that happened. \"Oh! \\nWhat have I done Akka?\" she asked with remorse.\\nBefore Kundavai could reply, the Prince intervened, \"Don\\'t \\nworry about that Vanathi! Anyone can make a mistake. \\nYou have every reason to be agitated.  I was explaining it \\nto my sister.\"\\nVanathi wondered if she was dreaming or if it was real. \\nThe Prince who never looked at any woman was talking to \\nher. He is consoling me and cheering me up! How can I \\nbear this fortune? - Look, how my whole body shivers,  I \\nam dizzy again....\\n\"Akka, my men are waiting. Permit me to leave. When you \\nsend me news from here, let me know how this girl feels. \\nLook after this orphan girl carefully.\" He then departed.\\nThe other maids and companions were watching all these \\nhappenings from the windows and balconies. The flame of \\njealousy began to glow in their hearts.\\nFrom that day onwards Kundavai showered a special \\naffection upon Vanathi. She kept her by her side \\nconstantly. She had her personal tutors teach her all the \\narts and learning she had. She took Vanathi along \\nwherever she went. She led her into the garden and talked \\nsecrets. She shared all her dreams about her younger brother with her new friend. Vanathi listened to everything \\ncarefully.\\nAfter the above incidents took place, Vanathi fell into \\nfainting fits four or five times. Kundavai would revive her \\nand soothe her. When Vanathi would sit up, with her chest \\nheaving with sobs, Kundavai would console her with \\nwords such as \"My dear foolish girl! Why are you crying \\nlike this?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know Akka! Please forgive me,\" Vanathi would \\nreply. Kundavai would embrace her and comfort her.\\nAll these activities further enraged the other maidens in the \\npalace. \\nTherefore, was it not natural for those girls to talk in that \\nfashion, when the two friends had gone away in the chariot \\ntowards Kudanthai?\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 17: ' A Horse Galloped\\nKundavai had decided that Vanathi was the appropriate \\nbride for her incomparable brother. But Vanathi had one \\nfault: she was too timid. How could a girl who was to \\nmarry the bravest of brave warriors, who was to give birth \\nto a son to rule the whole world, be so fainthearted? \\nKundavai wanted to change her timidity and make her \\nbrave and courageous. She had arranged for the deception \\nwith the stuffed crocodile for this very purpose. But, the \\nLady of Kodumbalur passed that test easily. \\nUpon returning from the house of the Kudanthai \\nAstrologer, Kundavai and Vanathi climbed into their swan \\nshaped barge. The barge floated downstream for a short \\ndistance. The girls would often play in the water amidst the \\nthick groves of trees. They reached their favorite spot and \\ndisembarked. When everyone had climbed down, one of \\nthe girls screamed \"Crocodile!\" \"Help!\" She was pointing \\nbeyond the tree near which they were standing. All the \\nother girls soon took up the cry and ran hither and thither.\\nBut Vanathi, who was usually of a frightened disposition, \\ndid not exhibit any fear. She was not scared even upon \\nseeing the horrible crocodile, with its wide  open jaws, right \\nnext to her. Vanathi was not afraid even when she saw the \\nfaces of the other girls who were pretending to be afraid \\naccording to Kundavai\\'s instructions. \\n\"Akka, the crocodile is powerful only when it is in the \\nwater; it has no strength when it is on land. Tell these girls \\nnot to be afraid!\" said Vanathi.4\"You deceiving thief! This is not a live crocodile; it is a \\nstuffed carcass! Someone has already told you that!\" said \\none of the other girls.\\n\"I am not afraid even if it is really aliv e. I am only afraid \\nof lizards.\"\\nIt was at this point, that Vandiya Devan arrived there to \\nsave those maids from the terrifying crocodile! He jumped \\noff his horse and in one run threw his spear as he came \\nrushing forward. When Vallavarayan heard the words  of \\nthe lady who stood in front of the crocodile, his whole \\nbody became alert.  His disappointment that she had not \\ntalked to him earlier at the astrologer\\'s house was now \\ndemolished.  \\nBut, that crocodile behind her - with its gaping jaws --\\nsomehow created an uneasiness in him. Why is she \\nstanding in front of the crocodile? Why is she asking me \\nnot to bother? And why is that horrible crocodile not \\nmoving from its spot all this time?\\nThe lady continued: \"Sir! In Kudanthai, you begged \\npardon for having entered the astrologer\\'s house in a hurry. \\nWe came away without giving you any reply. You might \\nhave perhaps construed that all women of the Chozla \\ncountry are mannerless creatures. Please do not think so. I \\nwas a little confused because my friend had sudden ly \\nfainted in that house. That is why I did not reply ... ...\"\\nOh, ho! What a pleasing voice this is? Why is my heart \\npounding like this on hearing her speak? Why is my throat \\nparched? Not even did the marching drums of the war, or \\neven the sweet music of  the flute and lute fill me with such \\njoy. Nothing shook me up like this. Why am I not able to \\ninterrupt her and say something? Why is my tongue tied? \\nWhy has the gentle breeze stopped? Why has the Arisil \\nstopped flowing?  And then .... this crocodile? Why  is it \\nstill, like this?\\nWhile Vandiya Devan\\'s heart was agitated in this manner, \\nhis ears could continue hearing that girl\\'s voice as if in a \\ndream: \"... even now, you did this Sir, thinking that you \\nwere saving us. You threw the spear at the crocodile. It is \\nrare to find gallants who can handle the spear with such \\nspeed and accuracy...\"\\nAll the other girls standing under that tree now laughed \\nsharply. The laughter shattered Vandiya Devan\\'s infatuated \\ndream. The magic cords, -- that girl\\'s speech -- which \\nbound him, were cut loose. He examined the crocodile \\nagain; moved aside from the girl in front of him and neared \\nthe reptile.  He shook the spear embedded on its back and \\npulled it loose. No blood gushed from the hole made by his \\nweapon: then? some plant ain fiber and cotton came out.\\nThose wicked girls laughed again. This time they clapped \\ntheir hands and applauded. Vallavarayan\\'s heart and body shrank with mortification. \\nHe had never met such disgrace ever before. Such a great \\nblow to his pride in fro nt of all these women! Are these \\nwomen? No, no! they are ogresses! I should not tarry next \\nto them. I should not look upon their faces. Damn this! My \\ndarling spear! Is this your fate, to suffer such dishonor? \\nHow will I wipe out this blemish? ...\\nAll these thoughts raced through Vandiya Devan\\'s mind \\nwithin one moment. If those who stood there laughingly \\nhad been men, the clearing would have turned into a \\nbattlefield! Those who dared to laugh would have lost their \\nlives that very instant! River Arisil would  have run red \\nwith their blood. But they were women! What could he do \\nto them? The only recourse was to run away and escape!\\nWithout even looking back at the face of the girl who had \\ncaptivated his mind, Vandiya Devan ran up the river \\nembankment. His hors e, which was standing up there, \\nneighed. Vandiya Devan felt that even his horse was \\nlaughing at him along with those girls. All his anger turned \\ntowards the horse. He jumped upon its back and smacked \\nit sharply, twice with his whip. The self -respecting horse \\nquickly galloped along the trail on the riverside.\\nFor a while, Kundavai Pirati gazed in the direction in \\nwhich the horse had galloped away. She watched till the \\ndust raised by the horse had settled.\\nTurning towards her companions, she said, \"Girls! N one of \\nyou have any refinement even now! You shouldn\\'t have \\nlaughed like that. When we are alone we can laugh and \\ntease as we wish. Don\\'t we have to show some decorum \\nwhen a stranger is in our midst? What would that youth \\nthink about the women of the Chozl a country?\" spoke \\nKundavai.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 18: ' Idumban Kari\\nWe left Azlvar-adiyan, also known as Thirumalai, at the \\nferry landing near Kollidam. Let us consider that \\nVaishnava zealot once again.\\nWhen Vandiya Devan sat upon his horse a nd rode away \\ntowards Kudanthai, Mr. Thirumalai started mumbling \\nthese words to himself:  \"This youth is very sharp. If I \\nenter through the sieve he squeezes in through the floor \\ndecoration. I have not been able to find the truth about \\nwhose man he is, or why and where he is going. I don\\'t \\nknow if he was part of the treasonable meeting at \\nKadamboor Fort. Luckily, I mentioned the Astrologer of \\nKudanthai to him! Let us see if that old man can find out \\nwhat I could not ...\"5\"Hello Sir! Are you talking to that ficus tree -- or, are you \\ntalking to yourself?\"  Hearing a voice behind him, Mr. \\nThirumalai turned around. The servant who had come from \\nKadamboor and procured the horse for Vandiya Devan, \\nwas standing there.\\n\"My good man! Are you asking me? I wasn\\'t talk ing to \\nmyself; neither was I talking to the tree. I had a little \\ndiscussion with a vampire sitting upon this tree,\" said Mr. \\nThirumalai.\\n\"Oh! Is that so, Sir! Is the vampire of the Saiva sect or of \\nthe Vaishnava sect?\" asked that good man.\\n\"That\\'s what I was trying to find out. You interrupted and \\nnow the vampire has disappeared. ... Let him go! ... What \\nis your name, my good man?\"\\n\"Why do you ask, Sir?\"\\n\"You saved us in the middle of the Kollidam by preventing \\nthe ferry-boat from overturning. Shouldn\\'t  I remember a \\ncommendable fellow like you?\\n\"My name ... My name ... is Idumban Kari, Sir.\" He said it \\nwith some hesitation.\\n\"Oh! Idumban Kari? I have heard it somewhere ... \\nbefore...\"\\nAt that time Idumban Kari did something very peculiar! \\nHe placed the spreading palms of both his hands one upon \\nthe other, and wriggled his thumbs. As he did this, he \\nlooked at Azlvar-adiyan\\'s face.\\n\"My dear man! What is this sign?  I don\\'t understand ...?\"\\nIdumban Kari\\'s dark face darkened further. His eyebrows \\ndrew close in exasperation. \"I? I didn\\'t make any sign,\" he \\nsaid.\\n\"You did. You did do so. I saw it. Exponents of the \\nclassical dance Bharata Natyam, hold a certain posture \\nwhen they represent the first incarnation of God Vishnu; \\nyou did something like that.\"\\n\"The first incarnation of Vishnu? What is that, Sir? I don\\'t \\nknow?\"\\n\"Don\\'t you know of Thirumal\\'s first incarnation? The \\nPisces!\"\\n\"Are you talking about fish?\"\\n\"Yes. My dear man! yes!\"\\n\"Very good Sir! Your eyes are something special! On an \\nordinary tree you can see a vampire and empty hands look \\nlike the fish incarnation. Perhaps, Sir, you have an extra \\nfondness for fish!\"\"No. No. No such thing my dear man! Don\\'t sidetrack me. \\nIf you wish, let us drop the matter. But tell me this: do you \\nremember that radical Saiva fellow who came with us in \\nthe boat? Do you know where he went?\"\\n\"Do I know? Oh yes. I saw him; he came along the same \\nroad when I went to buy the horse. He kept cursing you all \\nalong the way ...\"\\n\"What did he say?\"\\n\"He said that if he sees you again he would cut off your \\ntopknot and shave your head and ...\"\\n\"Ah! Does he know the barber\\'s trade?\"\\n\"He said that he would wipe out all the namam marks of \\nyour sect from your body and cover you with ashes!\"\\n\"Is that so? Then, I must surely meet him. Do you know \\nthe name of his home-town?\"\\n\"He said that it was Pullirukum Vellur, Sir.\"\\n\"Everything else must wait till I meet that zealot! My good \\nman, where are you going now? Will you be coming in \\nthat direction?\"\\n\"No. No. Why should I go there? I  have to cross the \\nKollidam and go back to Kadamboor. Won\\'t the master \\npluck my eyes out, if I don\\'t show up?\"\\n\"If that is so, go quickly my man! See, the ferry -boat is \\nabout to leave.\"\\nIdumban Kari looked back; what Azlvar -adiyan said was \\ntrue. The ferry-boat was about to leave.\\n\"That\\'s fine Sir. I shall leave immediately.\" After uttering \\nthese words he started walking quickly down the \\nembankment, towards the ferry landing. He looked back \\nonce, when he was half way down. By then Azlvar -adiyan \\nhad done a strange thing: he quickly climbed the ficus tree \\non the shore and reached the topmost branches of that huge \\ntree. Idumban Kari could not see him.\\nIdumban reached the ferry landing and stopped. \"Are you \\ncoming back to the other shore?\" asked a boatman.\\n\"No. I shall come in the next ferry. You can go,\" said \\nIdumban Kari.\\n\"Ah! Is that all? The way you came running down, I \\nthought you wanted to catch this boat!\" The boatman \\npushed his long pole into the water; the ferry slid into the \\ndeeps currents.\\nBy now Azlvar-adiyan had climbed into the thickest \\nbranches of the tree and completely concealed himself.  6Aha! I thought correctly! This fellow did not go in that \\nboat. He is going to come back. I must see where he goes \\nand what he does next. I clearly saw his hands make the \\nsign of the fish. What does it mean? Fish! Fish! Fish ...! \\nWhat is represented by the sign of the fish? Ah! isn\\'t the \\nfish a symbol on the Pandiya flag? Perhaps, ha! ... Could it \\nbe so? Let us wait ... Let me wait with some patience. The \\npatient ones shall inherit the fields; the hasty will get the \\nforest!  But these days it seems better to inherit the forest \\nthan the field. Anyway let me be patient...  Azlvar -adiyan \\nshared these thoughts with the invisible vampire in the \\ntree.\\nSoon, his expectations came true. The ferry -boat left \\nwithout Idumban Kari. Idumban looked up at the ficus tree \\nfrom where he stood. His eyes searched in all directions. \\nAfter making sure that Azlvar -adiyan was nowhere in sight \\nhe came back to the same spot under the t ree. His eyes \\nsearched around once again before he sat down. His eyes \\nkept looking hither and thither as if searching for someone \\nor something. But, he did not look up into the branches of \\nthe tree. Even if he had looked up he would not have \\nspotted Azlvar-adiyan easily for Thirumalai had hidden \\nhimself well.\\nAbout an hour passed in this fashion. Azlvar -adiyan\\'s legs \\nbegan turning numb. He could not remain hidden amidst \\nthe tree branches much longer. Idumban Kari did not \\nappear as if he was about to leave soon. How to escape? \\nHowever carefully he descended on the other side of the \\ntree, he was sure to make some noise. Idumban Kari would \\nsurely see him. He had a sharp knife thrust in his \\nwaistband. What guarantee that he would not use it?\\nWhat can I do? Shall I make horrible noises like a ghost or \\ndemon and jump down on him? If I jump like that he may \\nthink that the vampire is attacking him and fall down in a \\nfaint or run away. I can then run away and escape! ... \\nWhen Thirumalai Nambi Azlvar -adiyan was considering \\nthese options, it seemed as if his patience would be \\nrewarded.\\nA man could be seen walking up from the south west i.e., \\nthe Kudanthai road. Thirumalai\\'s intuition warned that \\nIdumban Kari was waiting for that man. Soon, his intuition \\nproved to be right.\\nUpon seeing the new man, Idumban Kari stood up. The \\nnewcomer made a sign like the one Idumban had made \\nbefore. That is, he placed the palm of one hand upon the \\nother and wriggled his thumbs, making the sign of the fish. \\nOn seeing it, Idumban made a similar sign with his hands.\\n\"What is your name?\" asked the newcomer.\\n\"My name is Idumban Kari. What is yours, Sir?\"\\n\"Soman Samban.\"\\n\"I was expecting you, Sir!\"\"I too came in search of you.\"\\n\"Where should we go?\"\\n\"Westward!\"\\n\"Where?\"\\n\"To the enemy memorial.\"\\n\"Near Thiru-puram-biyam ... \"\\n\"Don\\'t talk so loudly. If someone hears it?\"\\n\"There is no one here. I looked.\"\\n\"If someone is hiding near -abouts?\"\\n\"Impossible.\"\\n\"OK. Let us leave. I don\\'t know the way very well. You go \\nfirst. I shall follow you at a little distance. Stop and make \\nsure that I am following you as you go on.\"\\n\"Fine. It is not a good road. The path is full of stones and \\nthorns. We have to walk through forest and thicket. Watch \\nand walk carefully.\"\\n\"That\\'s alright. You leave no w. Even if it is a forest path, \\nhide if you see anyone. Understand?\"\\n\"Yes. I know.\"\\nIdumban Kari started walking westward along the banks of \\nthe Kollidam. Soman Samban followed him a little later. \\nAzlvar-adiyan waited on the tree till both were hidden \\nfrom his sight. He had watched and heard everything!\\n\"Ah ha! These are bad times! All sorts of unexpected \\nthings are happening. I think I am going to find out about \\nsome mysterious activity. God\\'s grace has given me the \\nopportunity to find out. Now, getting  details depends on \\nmy resource-fulness. I could not get all the details at \\nKadamboor. I should not be thwarted like that again. \\nThiru-puram-biyam Memorial means they are talking \\nabout the memorial temple for the Ganga King Prithvi -\\npathi. It is more than a hundred years since that memorial \\nwas built. It is now dilapidated! The forest has encroached \\nand surrounded that area. The village is quite away from \\nthe memorial. \\n\"Why are these men going there? If the matter is to be \\ndiscussed between these two, they  would have talked about \\nit here itself. There is no need to walk a league along a \\nforest path. I am sure some others are likely to come to that \\nspot. Why? Why did one of them refer to the memorial of \\nKing Prithvi-pathi as `The enemy memorial\\'?  Whose \\nenemy was Ganga Prithvi-pathi? Yes! My surmise is likely \\nto be true. Anyway let me find out. They have walked \\nalong the banks of the Kollidam. I shall walk along the 7River Manni. It doesn\\'t matter if the forest is thicker along \\nthe banks of the Manni. Why shou ld I bother about the \\nforest and hills or the stones and thorns. I am used to them \\n-- They have to be afraid of me!\"\\nMuttering these words and thinking such thoughts, Azlvar -\\nadiyan descended the ficus tree and went a little \\nsouthward. He came to the banks  of the River Manni and \\nstarted walking west. He walked through forests meeting \\nno one on the way and by about sunset he reached the \\nmemorial temple near Thiru -puram-biyam.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 19: ' Battlefield And Forest\\nIt was a practice among the Tamils of the ancient times to \\nerect a hero stone and raise a memorial for great warriors \\nwho died bravely in the battlefield. If the memorial was \\nmarked merely by a stone tablet the place was known as \\nthe stone monument of the warrior. If a statue of a divinity \\nwas consecrated along with the marker, the place came to \\nbe called a palli padai or memorial shrine and temple.\\nOne such memorial-temple existed near the village of \\nThiru-puram-biyam, on the northern banks of the River \\nManni about half a lea gue from Kudanthai. It had been \\nerected in memory of a great warrior, the Ganga King \\nPrithvi-pathi who had died in a great battle near that \\nvillage.\\nThose who read world history may recall that the great \\nbattles of Waterloo and Panipat changed the very co urse of \\nhistory. The battle of Thiru -puram-biyam had a similar \\nsignificance with regard to South Indian history. That \\nbattle took place in the year AD 885, about a hundred \\nyears before the times of our story. It is essential that all \\npersons interested in the history of the Tamils should know \\nthe details of that battle.\\nThe early Chozla kings of the Sangam Age -- Karikala \\nValava, Ilan-chet-chenni, Perunar-killi, Thodi-thot \\nSembiyan -- ruled with great fame and prosperity. For \\nabout five to six hundred year s after their times, a long \\neclipse clouded the fame of the Chozla\\'s. The Pandiyas in \\nthe south and the Pallavas of the north squashed the \\nChozlas into becoming petty chieftains. Towards the end, \\nthe Chozlas had to give up their coveted capital city, \\nUraiyoor, to the Pandiyas and move east. The Chozla \\nchieftains who moved east made Pazlayarai, near \\nKudanthai, their new capital. But they did not forget their \\nrights to their long time capital, i.e., Uraiyoor.  Neither did \\nthey give up their title of Rooster K ings -- a title of \\nmonarchs who ruled from Uraiyoor which was also known \\nas Kozliyoor (kozli in Tamil means rooster.)\\nOf the Chozlas of Pazlayarai, Vijayala became famous as \\nan incomparable, brave warrior. He had fought in the forefront of various battles  and had ninety-six war-wounds \\non his body. Latter day poets sang his praises enumerating \\nhis wounds to be `Ninety and twice of three more\\' and said \\nthat he `Wore on his brave body ornaments of battle -\\nwounds numbering ninety and six.\\' His son, Aditya Chozl a \\nwas comparable to his father in bravery. He also took part \\nin several great campaigns. Vijayala Chozla had retired in \\nhis old age after crowning his son as the king. \\nAt that time the enmity between the Pandiyas and Pallavas \\nhad grown to result in sever al skirmishes and fights. The \\nPandiya king of that time was Varaguna. The Pallava \\nmonarch was Aparajita. The battles between these two \\npowerful rulers often took place on Chozla territory! Just \\nlike the rooster caught in the midst of a clash between one \\nelephant and another, the Chozla people suffered: caught \\nin the midst of the enmity of two super -powers. \\nKing Vijayala tried to make the best use of these wars for \\ngaining his own supremacy. In each skirmish or battle he \\nwould join forces with one opponent  or the other. Victory \\nand defeat were equal: but the warrior spirit of Chozla men \\nbecame well established.\\nSeveral tributaries branch from the Cauvery to form a delta \\n-- the fertile lands  of the Chozla country. All these \\ntributaries branch and flow to t he south of the Cauvery. \\nThere is only one tributary between the Kollidam and \\nCauvery rivers. It is known as the River Manni. \\nThe final test of strength between the super -powers took \\nplace as a great battle near the village of Thiru -puram-\\nbiyam situated to the north of the Manni. The armed \\nstrength of both sides was more or less equal. Pallava \\nAparajita was supported by the Ganga King Prithvi -pathi. \\nAditya Chozla also supported Aparajita.\\nCompared to the armies of the Pandiyas, Pallavas and \\nGangas the Chozla battalion was tiny. But Aditya knew \\nthat if the Pandiyas were victorious this time, the Chozlas \\nwould be totally destroyed. Therefore, like the Cauvery \\nmixing into the mighty ocean, his tiny army joined the \\nlarger Pallava forces.\\nThe battlefield spread across one square league. The four \\ndivisions of the army -- chariot legions, elephant brigade, \\ncavalry and infantry were ready. When elephant clashed \\nwith elephant, like two mountains hurled against each \\nother, the skies thundered. Horses flew against h orses like \\nfurious storms thrown one against the other; lances and \\nlong spears held by the horsemen shone like lightning. \\nChariot dashed against chariot: broken into smithereens \\nand thrown in all directions. The noise of the whistling \\narrows and clashing swords filled the skies and shook the \\nfour corners of the world. After a fierce conflict lasting \\nover three days, the field looked like a sea of blood. Dead \\nhorses and elephants appeared like islands in that sea. \\nLifeless bodies formed dunes. Broken chariot s floated like \\ndriftwood from a sunken ship. Both sides had lost \\nthousands, tens of thousands of men.8After the first three days of battle, a very tiny battalion of \\nthe Pallavas remained intact. Those men who lived were \\nvery tired. But Pandiya forces atta cked again and again as \\nif they owned some divine spell against tiredness. A \\ncouncil-of-war was held in King Aparajita\\'s tent. The three \\nkings -- Aparajita, Prithvi-pathi and Aditya together with \\ntheir generals, met to discuss further action. They decided \\nthat they could no longer oppose the enemy; it was best to \\nretreat to the north of the Kollidam.\\nAt that point a miracle happened in the battlefield. \\nVijayala Chozla -- weak with old age, bearing numberless \\nwar-scars over his body, having lost the power t o use his \\nlegs because of wounds -- somehow came to the battle \\nfront. The old war-lion realized that if the Pallava forces \\nwithdrew beyond the Kollidam, the Chozla entity would be \\ncompletely wiped out. His roar instilled new life in the \\nremaining Pallava men.\\n\"One elephant; give me just one elephant,\" shouted the old \\nmonarch.\\n\"All our elephant brigade is lost. Not one elephant remains \\nalive,\" they said.\\n\"One horse. At least bring me one good horse,\" he asked.\\n\"Not a single horse survived,\" replied the m en.\\n\"At least, have two brave warriors of the Chozla nation \\nsurvived? If you are alive come forward!\" roared the brave \\nsoldier.\\nInstead of two, two-hundred came forward. \\n\"Two men -- with courage in their heart and strength in \\ntheir shoulders -- two among you lift me up. The others \\nfollow two after two to take their place. If the two carrying \\nme fall, those behind come forward.\" The bravest of brave \\nmen spoke with a firmness.\\nTwo giants came forward and lifted Vijayala onto their \\nshoulders. \"GO! Go to t he war-front!\" he roared.\\nA battle was still being fought in one corner of the field. \\nThe southern forces were fighting bravely, making the \\nnortherners retreat. Vijayala Chozla seated on the \\nshoulders of two brave men entered that fight. He rushed \\ninto the midst of the enemy legion, swirling two large \\nswords held in each hand; none could oppose him or stop \\nhim. Wherever he went dead bodies of enemy men rose in \\npiles on both sides. Men who retreated earlier came back \\nto see this miracle. They stood in shock  to see the inhuman \\nbravery of Vijayala Chozla. They cheered each other and \\ncame back to fight.\\nAnd that was it. The fickle Goddess of Victory changed \\nher mind; her favor was now bestowed upon the Pallava \\narmy. The three kings gave up the idea of retreati ng beyond the Kollidam. They too entered the battle field. \\nSoon the Pandiya army began its retreat. They did not stop \\ntill they reached the borders of their Pandiya Territories.\\nGanga Prithvi-pathi performed various deeds of valor that \\nday. He established his brave fame and gave up his life in \\nthe field.They erected a hero stone in his memory in the \\nbattlefield. Later it was built into a memorial -temple or \\npalli padai.\\nThat gory battlefield lay waste for a few years; not a weed \\ngrew on that land. People a voided going near the place. \\nAfter a while, forest began claiming the land for itself. \\nTrees and creepers began growing thickly around the \\nmemorial temple. Wolves took up abode among the \\nbushes. Owls and bats lived in the dark branches of tall \\ntrees. In the course of time, no one went near that temple. \\nOver the years the building began to crumble. Soon it \\nturned into ruins. By the times of our story, the place had \\nbecome a totally deserted ruin in the middle of a forest.\\nAzlvar-adiyan reached the ruined me morial when darkness \\nwas setting in. The gargoyles carved on the upper walls of \\nthe memorial stared at him and tried to frighten him. But \\nthat brave Vaishnava was not one to be frightened easily. \\nHe jumped up and climbed on to the roof of the structure. \\nHe then hid himself carefully amidst the branches of a tree \\nthat covered the roof. He kept watch in all directions. \\nSoon, his eyes were able to peer into the darkness and \\ndiscern various shapes. His ears were able to hear even the \\ntiniest of noises.\\nOne hour, two hours and even three hours passed after \\nsunset. The darkness around him was suffocating. Now \\nand then he heard the rasping sound of forest trees: \\nbranches rubbed against each other. There! a wild -dog was \\nclimbing a tree. An owl hooted; bats screeche d. Birds \\nfrightened by the wild-dog beat their wings loudly as they \\ntried to perch on higher branches. Wolves had begun to \\nhowl.\\nHe heard a noise above his head: looked up. Some small \\nanimal -- lizard or squirrel jumped to a different branch. A \\nsmall patch of the clear sky could be seen through the \\nbranches of the tree. Stars twinkled and peeped down. In \\nthat silent, dark forest the stars seemed to extend a friendly \\nsmile towards him. Therefore, Thirumalai Nambi Azlvar -\\nadiyan looked up at the stars and sta rted talking softly: \\n\"Oh! My dear star friends! Today you seem to be laughing \\nat the foolishness of these human beings on this earth. You \\nhave good reason to laugh! You might remember that \\nhorrible battle which took place in this very spot a hundred \\nyears ago; and how the whole area was a wretched ruin of \\nblood and death. Perhaps you were surprised at mankind \\nand their petty enmities! You wondered why they \\nbutchered each other to create rivers of red. It is called \\nbravery! Even a hundred years after a man \\'s death they \\nconsider him an `Enemy\\' -- they referred to it as the \\n`Enemy memorial\\'. They are going to meet near the enemy 9memorial and talk and conspire of more harm to the living \\nin the name of the dead! Oh you twinkling lights of the \\nskies! Why won\\'t you laugh? Yes. Laugh as much as you \\nwish. Dear God! Is my coming here a big waste? Is the \\nwhole night going to pass like this? Are those men, whom \\nI expected, coming here, or not? Did I hear wrong? Did I \\nnot see correct? Or did those men who made the sign of \\nthe fish change their plans and go some place else? -- What \\ndisappointment? Disappointment? I cannot forgive myself \\nif I am cheated today... Ah! ... I think I can see some light \\nin that direction. What is it? The light is now hidden. No. I \\ncan see it. No doubt now. Someone is coming here; he is \\nholding a torch of burning twigs. No, not one man -- I hear \\ntwo men. My waiting has not been wasted.\"\\nThe two men who came crossed the path and went beyond \\nthe memorial temple. They stopped in the midst of a smal l \\nclearing nearby. One fellow sat down. The man holding \\nthe lighted twigs looked around. There was no doubt: he \\nwas expecting some others. After sometime, two others \\ncame and joined them. They must have been very brave \\nmen; men who had come to that spot se veral times before. \\nOtherwise, they could not have found their way in that \\ndarkness in that forest. Those who came first and the late \\ncomers talked amongst themselves. But, Azlvar -adiyan \\ncould not hear a single word! Oh dear! All my effort seems \\nuseless. I cannot even see those men clearly. What shall I \\ndo?\\nTwo more men joined them very soon. They talked of \\nsomething to each other. One of the men who came last, \\nhad a bag in one hand. He opened the string tied around his \\nbag and poured its contents on the g round! Gold coins \\nshone brightly in the light of the burning twigs. The man \\nwho dropped the coins laughed like one possessed: \\n\"My friends! We are about to destroy the Chozla Kingdom \\nusing Chozla gold! Isn\\'t it funny?\" He laughed loudly \\nagain.\\n\"Ravidasa, don\\'t make such a racket! Let us talk softly,\" \\nsaid another.\\n\"Fine! What does it matter how we talk in this place? If \\nanybody hears us, it will be owls and bats; wolves and \\nwild-dogs; luckily they cannot repeat what they hear!\" \\nRavidasa laughed even more  loudly. \\n\"Maybe. But, it is better to talk softly.\"\\nThey started talking amongst themselves, softly. Azlvar -\\nadiyan felt that it was a waste to sit on top of that roof \\nwithout hearing anything. He must get down and go near \\nthe clearing to listen to their  talk. He must manage to avoid \\nthe danger from such activity. Azlvar -adiyan started down \\nfrom the roof top. His stocky body disturbed the tree \\nbranches and made a slight noise.\\nOne of the men in the clearing jumped up quickly, saying, \\n\"Who is that?\" Azlvar-adiyan\\'s heart stopped beating for a few seconds. There was no way of not being discovered, \\nexcept to run. Running would cause more noise. They will \\nsurely catch him. A vampire bat on the tree spread open its \\nhuge wings; it then opened and closed its win gs lazily \\nseveral times and whistled \"Oorm, oorm,\" loudly, twice.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 20: ' The First Enemy\\nAzlvar-adiyan gave his heartfelt thanks to the vampire bat \\nwhich helped him at the right time; a hooting owl gave \\nfurther aid. The conspirators gathered in the clearing \\nthought that the noise was made by the owl or the bat.\\n\"Hey fellow! This bat has frightened us. Kill it!\" said one \\nman.\\n\"No need. Sharpen your knives and save them for other \\nimportant tasks; keep them to rout the very r oots of our \\nenemy clans! Bats and owls are not our enemy; they are \\nour friends. We are awake when normal folk sleep. These \\nowls and bats are awake with us.\" The man called \\nRavidasa spoke these words.\\nThirumalai moved forward step by step, quietly, while h e \\nlistened to these words of Ravidasa. Soon he neared a large \\nmarudai tree. The roots of that hundred year old tree \\nspread in all directions. Hollow spaces could be found in \\nbetween and below the thick roots. Thirumalai stood in \\none such hollow blending hi s body with the tree trunk.\\n\"We have no dearth of funds as long as the royal treasury \\nin Tanjore exists. All we need is determination to complete \\nthe task we have undertaken. We should be capable of \\nguarding our secret from becoming known to anyone, until\\nthe assignment is done. We have to divide ourselves into \\ntwo groups. One group must travel to Lanka immediately. \\nThe other must go to the Thondai regions and wait for an \\nopportunity to achieve our goal. Both jobs must be \\ncompleted more or less at the same  time. If there is any \\ndelay after finishing with one enemy, the other fellow will \\nbecome forewarned. We should never let that happen. Do \\nyou all understand? Who among you are ready to go to \\nLanka?\" asked Ravidasa.\\n\"I can go.\" \"I shall go.\" Several voices  rose at the same \\ntime.\\n\"When we meet the next time, in the Pandiya Kingdom, let \\nus decide about who is to go to Lanka. Till then, we have \\nseveral arrangements to make here itself.\"\\n\"Which is the best way to go to Lanka?\" asked one man.\\n\"We can go by Kodi Karai. That is a good place to cross \\nthe sea. But it is difficult to reach Kodi Karai from here. 0Enemies all along the way; spies everywhere. Therefore it \\nis better to go to Sethu and cross the sea to Matottam. \\nThose going to Lanka must know how to swim  in the sea \\nand they must be ready to row a boat or catamaran if the \\nneed arises. Who among you knows how to swim?\"\\n\"I do.\" \"I can.\" said a few voices.\\n\"We must first meet Mahinda, the King of Lanka and then \\ncomplete our job. Therefore, at least one of u s who goes to \\nLanka must be able to speak the Singhala language. Ah! \\nWhy hasn\\'t our Soman Samban come yet? Did any of you \\nsee him today?\" asked Ravidasa.\\n\"Here, I am coming.\" The voice came from a spot very \\nclose to the hollow in which Thirumalai was hidi ng. \\nAzlvar-adiyan flattened his body further against the tree \\ntrunk. Dear, dear me! How troublesome it is, that my \\nwretched body has grown so prosperous.\\nTwo more newcomers came and joined the group in the \\nclearing. Azlvar-adiyan peeped out from his hidin g place, \\nshowing a bare minimum of his face outside the hollow. \\nHe recognized the late comers as the two men who had \\nmet under the tree on the southern banks of the Kollidam.\\nOn seeing the two new men, Ravidasa exclaimed, \\n\"Welcome! Welcome! I was afraid t hat you were in some \\ntrouble and may not come to this meeting. From where and \\nby which way are you both coming?\"\\n\"We came along the bank of the Kollidam. On the way, a \\npack of wolves surrounded us. It was quite difficult to \\nescape from them. That is why w e are late,\" said Soman \\nSamban.\\n\"There is reason if you are afraid of the tiger or lion! What \\ncan we achieve with the help of men who are afraid of \\nwolves?\" asked the man who was holding the lighted \\ntwigs.\\n\"Don\\'t say that my friend! The wolf or jackal is  worse than \\nany lion or tiger which is a solitary enemy that attacks \\nalone. We can fight against them and manage. But wolves \\ncome in packs. They are more dangerous. Didn\\'t our \\nincomparable king of kings loose the battle and give up his \\nlife because the Chozla jackals came in large packs all at \\none time? Would it have happened any other way?\"\\n\"We shall totally destroy the whole pack of wolves. We \\nshall kill their very roots.\" Soman Samban swore with \\nvehemence.\\n\"Here are the tools to help that cause!\" said Ravidasa, \\npointing at the gold coins. Soman Samban picked up a few \\ncoins and examined them. \\n\"Yes! The tiger symbol on one side; palm tree on the other \\nside,\" he exclaimed!\"Chozla gold! Lord Pazluvoor\\'s signet. I did what I said I \\nwould do. What news fr om the rest of you? Does Idumban \\nKari have any special news?\" asked Ravidasa.\\n\"Yes. He has news. Let him tell it in his own words,\" said \\nSoman Samban.\\nIdumban Kari began speaking: \"As per your orders, I \\njoined the household of Kadamboor Sambuvaraya and a m \\nworking as a servant in his palace. Last night my efforts \\nbore fruit. Yesterday, a huge banquet was held at \\nKadamboor. Several guests -- the Elder Lord Pazluvoor, \\nLord of Mazluvoor, Vanangamudi Munai Raya and others \\nhad come. The gypsy dance and velan at tam, the oracle \\ndance, took place. The man who danced as the divine -man \\nforetold the future when the spirit manifested him. His \\npredictions were helpful to our intentions. Everybody \\nthought that the Elder Lord Pazluvoor had brought his \\nYoung-Queen in the closed palanquin to the palace. Lord \\nPazluvoor announced that Emperor Sundara Chozla was in \\npoor health and that he was not likely to live long. All the \\ndignitaries met and decided that Prince Aditya Karikala \\nwas not the rightful heir to ascend the throne; they decided \\nthat Prince Madurandaka had the right to succeed as \\nCrown Prince. Some among them were doubtful if that \\nPrince would agree to accept the throne. Lord Pazluvoor \\nthen promised that `He will accept personally,\\' and opened \\nthe curtains of the clos ed palanquin. Prince Madurandaka \\ncame out from the palanquin and agreed to accept the \\nthrone...\"\\n\"They are going to crown that brave fellow who roams \\naround disguised as a woman! Very good! Let them crown \\nhim! Everything is happening according to our plan s. An \\ninternal confusion in Chozla politics is very useful to our \\ncause. Now, whatever happens, no one will suspect us! \\nIdumban Kari! You have brought very good and important \\nnews. But, how did you learn of all this? How did you get \\nthe opportunity?\" asked  their leader, Ravidasa.\\n\"I tried to put myself forward working in the inner \\nchambers of the palace. I was assigned the task of guarding \\nthe courtyard where the dignitaries met, to hold their \\ndiscussions at midnight. While on guard duty, I made good \\nuse of my eyes and ears.\"\\n\"Did you learn of anything else by making such good use \\nof your senses?\"\\n\"Yes. I found something else. Another fellow, a stranger, \\nwas spying on that midnight meeting and listening to \\neverything that was being said; he was hiding on the outer \\nramparts of the palace and watching everything.\"\\n\"Oh! Who was he?\"\\n\"A fanatic Vaishnava fellow with a topknot on his \\nforehead ....\"1\"Ah! Was it him? That\\'s what I surmised. What did you do \\nwith him? Did you report him to your masters and  get \\nhold of him?\"\\n\"No. I did not do that. I had thought that he may be one of \\nus. I thought that you may have sent him.\"\\n\"You made a big mistake! He is not one of us. He is short \\nand stocky; a quarrelsome fellow. His name is Thirumalai \\nAppan. Sometimes, he c alls himself Azlvar-adiyan \\nNambi.\"\\n\"Yes. That very same fellow. I realized my mistake this \\nafternoon when I found out that he was not one of us.\"\\n\"How did you find that?\"\\n\"One of the friends of my  younger master Kandamaran \\nhad also come to the fort las t night. I did find out that he \\nhad no connection with Lord Pazluvoor and his fellow \\nconspirators. That friend went to sleep in some corner. \\nThis morning, my younger master came to the banks of the \\nKollidam accompanying his friend. I heard him speak of \\nhis intentions and stood in front of him often in the course \\nof my duties. My master asked me to come along. The \\nmaster went back to Kadamboor from the north shore; but, \\nhe ordered me to go to the south shore and procure a horse \\nfor his friend before I return ed. I asked permission to visit \\nmy aunt in Kudanthai after that. That is how I could come \\nhere without any problem.\"\\n\"All this is fine! But, how did you find out about that \\nfanatic topknot fellow?\"\\n\"When the ferry boat on the Kollidam was about to leave,\\nthat fellow came and joined us in the boat. He exchanged \\nsome heated words with Kandamaran\\'s friend. Therefore, I \\ndoubted my conclusions about him being one of us. It \\nappeared as if he was waiting for me on the south shore of \\nthe Kollidam. So, I made our secret sign to him but he did \\nnot understand. I then knew that he was not one of us.\"\\n\"You have committed a grave error! You should not make \\nour sign to persons whose antecedents are not known. My \\nFriends! Please listen to this,\" said Ravidasa, and he \\ncontinued in a more agitated voice, \"Our assignment is in \\nKanchi. And in Lanka. Our greatest enemies are in these \\ntwo places. But, an enemy more important than those two, \\nour first enemy is Thirumalai Appan who wanders around \\nin the name of Azlvar-adiyan Nambi. He is capable of \\nthwarting our intentions and destroying all of us. He is \\ntrying to abduct that peerless lady who is our leader.\"\\nAfter announcing this, Ravidasa continued, \"In the future, \\nif any one of you see him, anywhere, in any circumstance, \\nuse any weapon in your hands to pierce his heart and kill \\nhim! If you carry no weapon, use your bare hands to choke \\nhim to death. Or destroy him cunningly with poison; push \\nhim into the flood to feed him to the crocodiles. Lure him \\nto a cliff top and push him t o death. Kill him mercilessly, like you would any poisonous snake, lizard or scorpion. \\nMore commendable, if you can give him up as a human \\nsacrifice to the Goddess Kannagi or the Goddess Kali. He \\nis going to be an impediment to our intentions as long as \\nhe is alive.\"\\n\"Mr. Ravidasa! You are saying this with such conviction. \\nHe must be a very artful fellow. Who is he?\"\\n\"He? He is a terribly capable spy!\"\\n\"Whose spy?\"\\n\"I was not sure myself, for a long time I suspected him to \\nbe a spy of Sundara Chozla or Aditya Karikala. I realized \\nthat he was not that. I now think that he is a spy of that evil \\nold she-devil who lives in Pazlayarai -- that Elder Pirati.\"\\n\"Ah! Is that true? Why does that old woman, involved in \\nher devotions to the Gods, need a spy?\"\\n\"All her devotions are rubbish! That old Queen\\'s devotion \\nto Shiva is as big a masquerade as this topknot fellow\\'s \\nVaishnava fanaticism! She is a fiend who is hostile to her \\nown son. That is why her very own brother, Lord \\nMazlavaraya of Mazluvoor quarrelled wit h her; he now \\nbelongs to that Pazluvoor fellow\\'s group.\"\\n\"Mr. Ravidasa, are there any others like that Vaishnava \\nextremist?\"\\n\"There is an astrologer in Kudanthai. I suspect that fellow. \\nHe pretends to foretell the future by astrology to one and \\nall and discovers their secrets. None of you should ever go \\nto him. If you go to him, you will surely be hoodwinked.\"\\n\"Whose spy is he? What do you think?\"\\n\"I have not been able to find out that! Perhaps he works for \\nthat false prince who is in Lanka now. But I a m not very \\nconcerned about that astrologer. He cannot do much harm \\nto us. I am apprehensive about that Vaishnava fellow. He \\nshould be killed upon sight: like some evil, poisonous \\ncreature!\"\\nAzlvar-adiyan, hidden under the hollow tree root, heard all \\nthis; his whole body was drenched in sweat and he \\nshivered with fright. He doubted if he could ever escape \\nwith his life from that forest. To top it all, he felt like \\nsneezing; just at that time! He tried as much as he could to \\ncontrol that wicked sneeze. He st uffed his face into his \\nscarf and \"Aatch\"  he sneezed. \\nAt that time the gentle breeze had died. The whispering \\ntrees were quiet. The quiet \"Aatch\" was heard very clearly \\nby the men gathered in the clearing. Ravidasa looked up \\nand said, \"There is some noi se near that marudai tree. Take \\nthe light over there and see what it is.\"2The man holding the lighted twigs came towards the tree. \\nAs he came closer and closer, the light increased. He had \\nto take just one more step, the light would then fall \\ncompletely on Nambi. Then, what will happen? It would \\nbe impossible to escape with his life.\\nAzlvar-adiyan\\'s heart beat faster and faster. He eyes looked \\nall around, up and down, searching for something to aid \\nhis escape. Nothing was obvious. The man came closer. \\nUp there, on that low branch above him, ... another giant \\nbat was hanging upside down! Quickly, he stretched his \\nhands out and plucked that vampire bat off its perch. He \\nhad a good idea!\\nAs soon as the man with the torch took another step and \\ncame closer, Thirumalai threw the vampire bat at him. The \\ntorch of twigs fell to the ground. The light dimmed. The \\nman, his face beaten by the strong wings of that huge bat, \\nstarted screaming. The noise of several men coming closer, \\nrunning closer, could be heard. Azlvar -adiyan also began \\nrunning. He ran deeper into the forest and soon \\ndisappeared.\\nSeveral shouts, \"What?\" \"What happened?\" could be \\nheard. The man who had held the torch began a protracted \\nexplanation of how the vampire bat attacked him! These \\nnoises were audible for quite sometime as Thirumalai ran \\nfurther away.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 21: ' The Curtains Parted\\nCan two minds function at the same time in one body? Yes \\n-- Vandiya Devan knew the answer because of his \\nexperiences that day!\\nHe was travelling through the most fertile of the bountiful \\nChozla lands. It was the season of new floods in all the \\nrivers and streams. Fresh water rushed through canals, \\nconduits and waterways into the lush fields; water was \\neverywhere. \\nHow appropriate, to call the Chozla land bounteous and its \\nmonarch the king of bounty! Thoughts of the dangers \\nsurrounding the Chozla monarch immediately followed. \\nWhat is my duty in this situation? Shall I keep quiet after \\ndelivering the letters sent by Prince Karikala to the \\nEmperor and think that my duty is done? Why should I \\ninterfere in this discord and hostility between royal \\ncousins? How does it concern me, whoever sits on the \\nChozla throne? In some ways, if I think of it, these Chozlas \\nare my ancestral enemies. Did not the Chozlas, Gangas and \\nVaithumbas join together to destroy the very existence of \\nmy forefathers of the Vanakapadi Kingdom? Can I forget \\nall that injustice just because Prince Karikala befriends me \\ntoday? No, no! -- How can I consider that old history as inj ustice? \\nIt is natural that kings fight and oppose each other. Victory \\nand defeat are both natural. What is the use of the defeated \\ngroup resenting the victorious? When they were powerful, \\nweren\\'t my forefathers ruthless towards the kings they \\nvanquished? Did they not try to completely destroy their \\nenemies? Ah! What was that poem ? I can remember a \\npoem about such activities of my clan: -\\nWith countless armies made into leaf -mulch,With the flowing red of battlefields stored for irrigation,In a dirt field ploughed by the war elephant,That Vaana, the best of kings on this earth,He planted the heads of the three kings: his enemies.\\nMy ancestors also committed such dreadful deeds in the \\nbattlefield! The lot of those defeated in battle is \\nlamentable. Can all kings be merciful like Rama and \\nDharma of the epics? Because of their merciful nature they \\nwere driven to the forests to suffer! Those epic heros \\nsuffered even though they were brave and were befriended \\nby gallant men. There should be no mercy shown in \\nmatters of politics! If one thinks about it, we should \\nconsider these Chozlas as being more tolerant and merciful \\nthan any other such monarchs. If possible, they make \\nfriends with their enemies. Didn\\'t King Arinjaya marry the \\nVaithumba Princess? Isn\\'t it bec ause of that famous \\nbeauty, the Princess Kalyani, that Sundara Chozla and his \\nchildren are so handsome?  Ah! ... when I think of beauty, \\nthe face of that maiden of Kudanthai, that lady on the \\nbanks of River Arisil, comes to my mind! She is not \\ncoming into my mind suddenly from somewhere ... her \\npresence has been lurking in my heart all this while...\\nWhile his outer mind considered the complications of \\nChozla politics and enjoyed the beauties of Chozla land, \\nhis inner mind dwelt upon that maiden. Now the in ner \\nmind and outer mind began to consider the same object, \\nfrankly. He began to compare any beautiful sight to her \\nenchanting personality. He recalled her lovely shoulders \\nwhen he saw the grace of slender bamboos swaying in the \\nbreeze. The profuse blooms o f creek-side water lilies were \\nexample of her dark eyes. He doubted if the lovely lotus \\ncould equal her golden face. Can he liken the sweet \\nmelody of bees humming in flower groves to her pleasing \\nvoice? \\nPoets can imagine such nonsense -- how can they be \\nreality? How beautiful she was! The very memory of her \\nface makes my heart beat faster! I am not enthralled like \\nthat by these flowers and bees. Oh! Oh! I have forgotten \\nall the advice given by my elders! There is nothing more \\nimpermanent in this world tha n the allure of women. \\nThose who wish to succeed in life should never be enticed \\nby the charm of women. If one falls prey to their \\nenchantment it is the end! The story of Kovalan is a good \\nexample of that -- Why  think of Kovalan? Look at Lord \\nPazluvoor! That most powerful personage, the bravest of \\nsoldiers -- aren\\'t people making fun of him because of such \\na predicament? -- but the people do not know the truth! No 3one knows about who travels in the closed palanquin with \\nLord Pazluvoor. They talk in ignoran ce. Still, Prince \\nMadurandaka need not demean himself in that fashion. \\nWhy should he hide in a closed palanquin under the guise \\nof Lord Pazluvoor\\'s queen, and go from town to town? Is \\nthis commendable in any man? Should he acquire his \\nkingdom in this manne r? Can he safeguard his gains \\nobtained in this fashion? He will have to trust Lord \\nPazluvoor and his cronies and rule dominated by their \\npower. On that issue -- what Sundara Chozla does is also \\nnot commendable; he should not have given such \\nprerogatives and powers to persons like the Lords of \\nPazluvoor. That too when he has two such capable, \\nexquisite sons. And when he has a daughter whose \\nintelligence and skill is praised by the whole nation...\\nThat maiden -- whom I saw at the astrologer\\'s house and \\nmet on the banks of the river -- whom does she resemble? \\n...  Could it be possible? -- absolute foolishness! It can \\nnever be so! But, why not? If it is so, there is none more \\nill-fated than me. How did I behave? -- so uncivilized --\\ntowards a lady admired by one  and all from the Vindhya \\nMountains to Lanka Island. It is not possible... How can I \\nface her tomorrow when I deliver the Prince\\'s letters?\\nWith such disconnected thoughts crowding his mind, \\nVandiya Devan came along the Cauvery to reach the town \\nof Thiru-vai-aru. He stood on the southern banks of the \\nCauvery, looking across the river to see the town on the \\nnorthern bank. The fertility and beauty of that country \\noverpowered his heart. He asked a passerby and confirmed \\nthat it was indeed Thiru -vai-aru. All that he had heard \\nabout that place seemed to be paltry compared to reality.\\nThe description of that town by Gnana -sambanda in his \\nThevaram poems could be recognized in the actuality. \\nThere was no change in three hundred years. \\nLook at those luscious grov es of trees on the Cauvery \\nbank. How big are the fruits hanging from the trunk and \\nbranches of the jack-tree! There is nothing like this in the \\ndry Thondai region! Look at those monkeys gathered in \\nthese fertile lands. How delightful to see them jump from \\ntree to tree! I remember the descriptions in Gnana -\\nsambanda\\'s poems: \\nMaidens dance on the stages set in the street -corners of \\nThiru-vai-aru. Song and music accompany that dance with \\nmelodious drumbeats; Monkeys hearing those drums \\n(mattalam) think that the skies are thundering with an \\napproaching storm: they climb to the top of palm trees and \\nlook up at the skies waiting for the rains!\\nHow appropriate that description is even now? Look at \\nthose long-tailed monkeys scampering among tree -tops. I \\ncan hear the sounds of music and dance from the town! \\nAlong with the melody of the veena, flute and other such \\ninstruments, I can hear the sounds of dancing feet and \\nankle bells! The dancers here are not frenzied like the \\ngypsy dancers of Kadamboor. This is classica l dance --decorous Bharata Natyam in full dignity. The music is \\nfrom established classical culture. I can even hear the tap -\\ntap of dance teachers beating time as their students \\npractice!\\nTeachers keep time, while beguiling damsels dance;Poets speak enchanting verse, making every sculpted stone come alive;Such accomplished people stroll in the streets of Thiru -vai-aru.\\nAha! Gnana-sambanda was a good devotee of Shiva but, \\nmore than that he was an connoisseur of the arts! This \\ntown is exactly as he descri bed it! I must stay in this town \\nat least for tonight and enjoy this music and dance and I \\nmust worship at the shrines of the Lord of the five -rivers \\nand the Lady who nurtured justice. Look at all those \\ndevotees at prayers on the banks of the Cauvery. How \\nelegant they look with their foreheads adorned with broad \\nashen marks! Their chants of \"Namasivaya\" drown the \\nsounds of the music and dance. Look, someone is singing \\nthe Thevaram songs so exquisitely. This town seems to be \\ncreated by the Gods just for musi c and song! I must stay \\nhere tonight. What is the use of hurrying to Tanjore? I \\ndon\\'t know if I can even enter the fort? Even if I manage to \\ngo in, will I be able to meet the Emperor? The two Lords \\nof Pazluvoor are said to guard the Emperor as if in prison\\n... Let me cross the Cauvery and go north.\\nWhen Vandiya Devan came to this conclusion, something \\nhappened. A palanquin was approaching along the \\nCauvery from the west. Footmen and guards walked in \\nfront and behind the palanquin. A suspicion crossed \\nVandiya Devan\\'s mind. He waited at the same spot till the \\npalanquin came nearer. His surmise was correct. He could \\nsee the sign of the palmtree emblazoned upon the outer \\nscreens of the covered palanquin. \\nYes! This palanquin must be coming from Kadamboor! \\nThey must have come by some other route, while I came \\nthrough Kudanthai. But, there is no sign of Lord \\nPazluvoor! Maybe he is delayed somewhere on the way.\\nThe palanquin turned south on to the Tanjore road. That \\ndecided it -- Vandiya Devan abandoned the idea of \\ntarrying at Thiru-vai-aru. He decided to follow that \\npalanquin. Why did he decide to do so? Even he did not \\nknow at that time! He was sure that Prince Madurandaka \\nwas seated inside the palanquin. His feelings of disgust \\nabout the Prince increased. Still , he might find some good \\nopportunity if he followed the palanquin. The bearers \\nmight put down the palanquin or the Prince might emerge \\nfor some reason or other. He could make his acquaintance \\nand it might help him in entering the fort at Tanjore and \\nmeeting the Emperor. \\nI must speak and put up a pretense suitable to achieve my \\ngoal. If I don\\'t use such strategy and conniving I cannot \\ncomplete my assigned task; particularly in such political \\nmatters.4Therefore, he let the palanquin and its guards go ahea d and \\nthen followed them at a little distance. But no expected \\nopportunity arose. They had already crossed the remaining \\nfour rivers between Thiru -vai-aru and Tanjore. The \\npalanquin was not put down. The bearers walked steadily. \\nHe could soon see the rampa rts and gates of the outer fort \\nof Tanjore in the distance. Once the palanquin enters the \\nfort, nothing can be done. He must do something bold and \\nfearless. \\nWhat can happen? Will they chop off my head? It\\'s alright \\nif they do so -- there is no point going back with my life if \\nI am unable to complete my assigned task. As a basis for \\nall this thought, Vandiya Devan had a certain anger and \\ndisgust about the prince in the palanquin. His hands itched \\nto tear apart the curtains of the palanquin and expose the \\nfact that the person inside was not a woman but a full \\ngrown man! His heart was agitated!\\nWhile he was considering various options to execute his \\nintentions, one of the men in the retinue of the palanquin \\nhesitated. He stared at Vandiya Devan seated on his  horse.\\n\"Who are you Sir? You have been following us from \\nThiru-vai-aru?\" he asked.\\n\"I am not following you Sir! I am going to Tanjore. \\nDoesn\\'t this road lead to Tanjore?\"\\n\"Yes. This is the road to Tanjore; but, only important \\npersons can use this road.  There is another road for \\ncommoners,\" said that man.\\n\"Is that so? I too am quite an important person!\" said \\nVallavarayan Vandiya Devan.\\nThe man smiled upon hearing this, \"Why are you going to \\nTanjore?\" he asked.\\n\"My uncle lives in Tanjore. I heard that  he was not keeping \\ngood health and am going to visit him.\"\\n\"What does you uncle do in Tanjore? Is he in service at the \\nPalace?\"\\n\"Oh, no! He is an inn-keeper.\"\\n\"Ah! Is that so! Then, why don\\'t you go before us? Why do \\nyou follow us?\"\\n\"My horse is tired Sir. That\\'s why. Otherwise what \\npleasure do I have, to see your backsides?\"\\nIn the course of this conversation, Vandiya Devan came \\nvery close to the palanquin. An idea had occurred to him. \\nHe pulled in the reins, pressed both his legs against its \\nflanks and pushed his horse towards the bearers carrying \\nthe end poles of the palanquin. They turned in fear and \\nsurprise. Vandiya Devan immediately started shouting \"Oh King, \\nMy Lord! My Sire! Your bearers are pushing against my \\nhorse! Help! Help! Oh dear!\" \\nThe screens shook and parted.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 22: ' Velaikara Battalion Of Velirs\\nFirst, the outer screens emblazoned with the palmtree \\nsymbol parted; next the silken inner curtains were pushed \\naside. The golden hand seen by Vallavarayan o nce before, \\nthe hand which had stunned him, could be seen once again. \\nThinking that it was no longer polite to be seated on his \\nhorse, Vandiya Devan climbed down. \\nHe ran up to the palanquin saying \"Prince! Prince! Your \\nbearers ...\" and looked inside. He looked again; he blinked \\nhis eyelids and looked once again! His eyes were dazzled! \\nHis tongue tied itself into knots! Suddenly his throat felt \\nparched. \"No. No! Princess! Princess of Pazluvoor! ... \\nYour Ladyship, Princess of Pazluvoor! ... Your bearers and\\ntheir horses dashed against my palanquin ...\" came the \\nflustered blabberings.\\nAll this happened within the blink of an eyelid! By now \\nthe guards carrying the long spears ran up and surrounded \\nVandiya Devan. He realized that the men were around \\nhim; his hand automatically reached for his sword. But he \\ncould not take his eyes off the dazzling face of that \\nenchantress behind the curtains!\\nYes; unlike his expectations, this time he unquestionably \\nsaw the beautiful figure of a young girl seated inside the \\npalanquin! Girl means what a girl! Vandiya Devan hadn\\'t \\nknown that such beauty, which could madden those who \\nbeheld it, could exist in this world.\\nFortunately, some nerve in his brain became active at that \\nmoment. An amazing idea rose in his mind. He decided  to \\nmake use of that idea. He made a tremendous effort and \\ncleared his throat, bringing back speech to his tongue. \"I \\nbeg pardon! My Lady, aren\\'t you the Young -Queen of \\nPazluvoor? I came this far to make thy acquaintance!\" \\nspoke his tongue.\\nA smile blossomed on the gentle face of the Young -Queen \\nof Pazluvoor. A lotus bud, which was closed shut till that \\nmoment, opened slightly to reveal a string of tiny pearls. \\nThe radiance of that smile mesmerized our young warrior \\nand absolutely bewildered him.\\nThe footmen surrounding him seemed to wait for the \\ncommands of their mistress. The Lady made a sign with \\nher finger; they moved away a little and stood apart. Two \\nmen caught hold of the horse and waited.5That jewel among women, seated in the palanquin, looked \\nat Vandiya Devan. Two sharp spear -points pierced his \\nheart!\\n\"Yes! I am the Young-Queen of Pazluvoor,\" said that \\nLady. What is that intoxicating stuff mixed into her voice? \\nWhy is my head spinning with such dizziness upon hearing \\nher speak?\\n\"What did you say just now? You appealed to me about \\nsomething? About my bearers?\"\\nCan the softness of Benaras silk, the intoxication of \\ncountry liquor, the sweetness of forest honey and the flash \\nof monsoon lightning blend like this into the voice of a \\nyoung maid? It seems quite possible here...\\n\"You said they dashed my palanquin against your horse?\"\\nThe mocking smile playing upon her coral red lips \\nindicated that she was enjoying the joke. Vandiya Devan \\ngained some courage because of it.\\n\"Yes. Great Queen! These men d id that; my horse was \\npetrified.\"\\n\"You also look petrified! Go to the priest at the temple of \\nGoddess Durga and ask him to exorcise you! You will \\novercome this terror!\"\\nBy now, Vandiya Devan had overcome his fear and even \\nlaughter came back! The Pazluvoo r Queen\\'s expression \\nhad now changed: a smiling full -moon turned into blazing \\nanger!\\n\"Stop jesting. Tell the truth. Why did you push your horse \\nagainst my palanquin and stop me?\"\\nHe had to give a plausible answer. If not... Luckily he had \\nalready concocted a story. In a soft voice, a deliberately \\nsoft voice, he spoke as if he did not wish others to hear his \\nwords: \"My Lady! Madam Nandini Devi! He... Mr. \\nAzlvar-adiyan, that is ... Mr. Thirumalai, he ... he asked me \\nto meet you! That is why I connived this strategy. Please \\nforgive me. I beg pardon!\" \\nAs he said the words he examined her face carefully. He \\nwaited anxiously, to see the effect of his reply. It was like \\nthrowing a stone at a fruit tree. Will a ripe fruit fall? Or, \\nwould it be raw? Or, will the stone fall back on him? Or, \\nwill some unexpected thunder descend?\\nThe dark brows of the Pazluvoor Queen shot up -- surprise \\nand fear filled her intoxicating eyes. The next instant, she \\nseemed to have come to some decision.\\n\"Fine! It is not safe to stop i n the middle of a road and talk. \\nCome to my palace tomorrow. You can explain everything \\nthere.\"Vandiya Devan\\'s heart filled with bliss. His intentions \\nwere about to be fulfilled, but there was no use in leaping \\nacross three fourths of an open well! He mu st leap across \\nthe remaining quarter.\\n\"Madam! My Lady! They will not let me come inside the \\nfortress! Neither will they let me enter the palace! What \\nshall I do?\" he asked with some agitation.\\nThe Young-Queen of Pazluvoor instantly turned aside and \\npicked up a silken purse lying next to her. She opened the \\nbag and took out an ivory signet ring. Saying, \"If you show \\nthis they will let you into the fort and permit you to enter \\nmy palace,\" she gave him the ring. Vandiya Devan \\nreceived it eagerly. For a secon d, he glanced at the ring \\nwith the sign of the palm tree. Then, he looked up to thank \\nthe lady. But, the screens were pulled shut once again.\\nAh! An eclipse swallows the full -moon slowly, bit by bit. \\nBut these silken screens have covered that eloquent \\nradiance in one moment!\\n\"Do not follow me anymore. It may be dangerous. Wait \\nand come later,\" said that silken voice from inside the \\ndrapes.\\nThe palanquin moved on. The guards walked ahead, \\naround it like before. Vandiya Devan stood by the \\nroadside, holding the reins of his horse. His eyes noted that \\nthe Pazluvoor footman who had stopped to talk to him \\nlooked back several times; the message reached his inner \\nbrain. His outer brain revolved around the enchanting face \\nof the Young-Queen of Pazluvoor. Did all t his truly \\nhappen? Was everything a pleasing dream? Can there be \\nsuch beauty, such a ravishing form on this earth?\\nMyth and fable talk of divine maidens -- heavenly beauties \\ncalled Ramba, Urvasi and Menaka. There are tales about \\nhow those beautiful maidens  disturbed the penance of \\nascetics who foreswore all worldly pleasures. But in \\nreality! ... There must be truth in the rumor about the Elder \\nLord Pazluvoor being a bonded slave to this ravishing \\nlady. There is no surprise if it is true. What contrast \\nbetween Lord Pazluvoor -- old and grey, with a body \\ndisfigured by scars of several battle wounds -- and this \\nsoft, gentle, dazzling maiden? What deeds will that old \\nman perform, to obtain one smile from her?\\nHe waited for a long time by the roadside, mulling o ver \\nsuch thoughts. Finally, he mounted his horse and slowly \\nrode towards the gates of Tanjore.\\nBy sunset, he neared the main entrance to the city fort. The \\ncity extended for some distance before the fortress walls \\nand gates. Market streets offering severa l kinds of goods \\nfor sale, residential streets of people engaged in various \\ntrades -- these successively surrounded the outer \\nboundaries of the fort. All the streets were busy with the \\nhustle and bustle of a large town:  people going hither and \\nthither, merchants haggling over the price of goods they 6sold, carts and wagons drawn by hefty, well fed bullocks, \\nhorse drawn chariots, palanquins and litters filled the \\nstreets. \\nVandiya Devan was eager to enter those streets and \\nexperience the sights and sounds o f the new capital of the \\nChozlas; he wished to make the acquaintance of these city \\nfolk and become familiar with their ways. But, there was \\nno time for all that now. He must first complete the \\nassignment on which he had journeyed so far. Sightseeing \\nmust wait. With this determination he neared the main \\ngates of Tanjore.\\nThe massive doors of the main gateway were closed shut \\nat that time. The guards and gatekeepers outside were \\ntrying to maneuver the people making them stand in an \\norderly fashion on both si des of the street. The people \\ncomplied and stood aside. Yes; instead of going about their \\nown business they stood by the roadside as if in \\nanticipation of some procession or parade. Men, Women, \\nchildren and elderly -- everybody waited.\\nFor a short distance the street in front of the gateway was \\nempty. The guards stood near the doorway. Vandiya \\nDevan wished to find out what was happening. He did not \\nwish to entangle himself with the gatekeepers when \\neveryone else stood aside. Unnecessary dispute and trouble\\nmight come of it. The job on hand was more important \\nthan a joust. It was not the time to pick an unwanted \\nquarrel.\\nTherefore, he stood to one side at a spot where he could \\nkeep an eye on the gateway. The heady fragrance of \\nflowers rose by his side. He l ooked around. A youth, \\nwearing the symbols of a Saiva devotee, such as rudraksha \\nbeads around his neck and ashen marks on his forehead, \\nstood by his side carrying two large baskets of flowers in \\nboth his hands.\\n\"Thambi, why has everybody moved to one side  of the \\nroad? Is some procession or something coming this way?\" \\nasked Vandiya Devan.\\n\"Are you not from these parts, Sir?\"\\n\"No. I come from the Thondai Territories.\"\\n\"That\\'s why you asked! It may be better if you also \\ndismount and stand aside.\"\\nVandiya Devan jumped off his horse, thinking it would be \\neasier to converse with that youth. \"Thambi why did you \\nask me to dismount?\"\\n\"All these people are standing aside because the Velaikara \\nBattalion of Velirs is about to emerge from the fort after \\npresenting arms to the Emperor.\"\\n\"Just to watch?\"\"Yes.\"\\n\"Why shouldn\\'t I watch while sitting upon my horse?\"\\n\"You can. But, it is dangerous if the  men of the Velaikara \\nBattalion see you.\"\\n\"What danger? Will they abduct my horse?\"\\n\"They will abduct the horse; even carry away men! \\nWicked fellows!\"\\n\"Will they be allowed to carry away horse or man?\"\\n\"What can one do but allow it? The word of those men of \\nthe Velaikara Battalion is law in this city. There is none to \\nquestion them. Even the men of Pazluvoor do not  interfere \\nin the affairs of the Velaikara Battalion of Velirs.\"\\nAt that time, a loud commotion and noise could be heard \\ninside the fort. The sound of kettle -drums, blowing \\nconches, pipes being played, horns being blown and \\nmarching drums being beaten min gled with loud, cheering, \\nshouts raised by hundreds of men.\\nVandiya Devan had heard much about the brave warriors \\nof the Velaikara Battalion. It was an important \\norganization in the ancient Tamil nations, particularly in \\nChozla dominions. `Velaikaras\\' wer e the personal \\nbodyguards of the ruling monarch. But there was an \\nimportant difference between them and ordinary \\nbodyguards. The men of this battalion had taken individual \\noaths to \"Personally guard the life and person of the king, \\ngiving up their own life  if the need arises.\" If something \\nuntoward happened to the king or his life, because of their \\ncarelessness or in spite of their guard, they had sworn to \\ncut off their heads with their own sword and offer \\nthemselves as a sacrifice to the Goddess Durga. It was \\nnatural that such men, who had sworn such terrible oaths, \\nwere given ceratin privileges.\\nThe two large doors of the gateway opened with a loud \\nnoise. Two horsemen emerged first. In their right hands \\nthey held aloft two narrow pennants flying high. The y \\nwere curious in design. The red cloth of the banner was \\npainted with a leaping tiger and a shining crown below it; \\nunderneath the crown was a sacrificial alter with a severed \\nhead on it and a huge sacrificial sword lay next to it. The \\npennant was quite terrifying to behold.\\nA huge bull, carrying two immense war -drums followed \\nbehind the horsemen. Two men walking by its sides beat \\nthe reverberating drums. About fifty men in formation \\nfollowed the bull; they carried small and large kettle -\\ndrums, cymbals, bells and chimes -- beating them and \\nbanging then loudly.\\nFifty others followed them, blowing \"Boom, boom, boam\" \\nupon long curved horns and pipes. About a thousand 7soldiers followed these men. They raised the following \\ncries and cheers as they marched out:\\n\"Long live Emperor Paranthaka of the blessed earth.\"\\n\"Praise to him! Long life! Long life!\"\\n\"Long live Sundara Chozla!\"\\n\"Long life! Long life!\"\\n\"Long life to the Rooster King!\"\\n\"Long life! Long life!\"\\n\"Lord of Tanjore!\"\\n\"Long life! Long life!\"\\n\"Long life to the Lord who vanquished Veera -pandiya!\"\\n\"Long life! Long life!\"\\n\"Long life to the Monarch who took Madurai, Lanka and \\nThondai!\"\\n\"Long life! Long life!\"\\n\"May the clan of Karikala Valava live long with fame!\"\\n\"Long life! Long life!\"\\n\"Victory to Goddess D urga, the Greatest, the all \\npowerful!\"\\n\"Victory! Victory!\"\\n\"Let the brave tiger-flag fly worldwide and win!\"\\n\"Victory! Victory!\"\\n\"Victory to our spears!\"\\n\"Victory to the brave spears!\"\\nThe loud cheers raised by hundreds of strong voices, \\nhypnotized those who heard them. While the shouts rose \\nnear the fortress gateway, they echoed and thundered in all \\ndirections. Many of the people standing on both sides of \\nthe road joined the cheering.\\nThus, everything was one big commotion while the men of \\nthe Velaikara Battalion of Velirs emerged from the \\ngateway, marched past the long street and disappeared in \\nthe distance.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 23: ' Amudan\\'s Mother\\nThe Velaikara Battalion wound its way through the main \\nmarket street. Some of the men walking  towards the end of \\nthe parade performed certain audacities in that \\nmarketplace. One fellow entered the shop of a food vendor \\nand carried out a basket of sweet -cakes; he distributed the \\ncakes to his friends. When he crowned the vendor with the \\nupturned empty basket, all his friends laughed \\nuproariously \"Ha ha ha haha ha.\" \\nAnother gallant fellow plucked the flower tote from the \\nhands of an elderly woman. Scattering the flowers in all \\ndirections he shouted \"Hey friends, its raining flowers!\" \\nTwo soldiers trying to catch the flowers shouted gleefully \\nand raised a hue and cry! Yet another fellow stopped a \\nbullock cart on the road and unyoked the beast from the \\ncart; he drove the animal into the crowd by twisting its tail; \\nthe terrified animal ran helter skelte r in the crowd, plunging  against innocent bystanders. Gleeful laughter \\nfollowed this endeavor!\\nVandiya Devan was watching all this. Aha! These fellows \\nalso tease and play pranks just like the men of Pazluvoor. \\nTheir pranks are irksome to others. How fort unate that I \\nescaped their sight by standing aside. Otherwise, a little \\nconflict would have taken place! My venture would have \\nbeen wrecked, he thought. But one difference was obvious \\nto him. The people on these streets did not resent these \\nactivities of the Velir men very much. Some of them even \\njoined in their pranks and enjoyed the merriment and \\nlaughter.\\nWhen he turned around to ask about this, the youth with \\nthe flower baskets was nowhere to be seen. He had \\nvanished somewhere in the crowd and commotio n. \\nPerhaps he had gone on his business.\\nOn approaching the gate, he found that no one was allowed \\ninside the fort after the Velaikara Battalion left for the day. \\nOnly members of the royal household, the ministers and \\ngenerals had the right to enter or lea ve the fort at all times \\nof night or day. Vandiya Devan heard that the households \\nof the Lords of Pazluvoor also had that privilege.\\nHe changed his intentions of entering the fort that very \\nnight. He did not wish to show the signet ring in his \\npossession and try its powers. It is better to spend the night \\noutside the fortress, do some sightseeing and enter after \\nsunrise tomorrow. Even if I go in tonight, it is not possible \\nto gain entry into the royal palace and meet the Emperor to \\ndeliver my letters.\\nVandiya Devan rode slowly along the streets surrounding \\nthe outer ramparts of Tanjore Fort enjoying the various \\nsights presented around him. His horse, which had crossed \\nseveral leagues that day was very tired. Soon he must give \\nit some rest. Otherwise, tomor row, when the need arose \\nthe horse may become useless. He must soon find a \\ncomfortable place to spend the night.\\nTanjore was at that time a new, growing, spreading city. It \\nwas evening time. Hundreds of street lamps had been lit \\nthrowing brilliant light e verywhere. All the streets were \\nnoisy with crowds of people. Travellers from far and near, \\nwho had come to the city on various businesses walked \\nhere and there. People from other Chozla cities and \\ncountryside were there. Persons from nations taken into the\\nChozla fold recently were also there. Several folks \\ncrowded to that capital city from nations spreading across \\nthe lands between the North Pennar river and the southern \\nCape, and between the eastern seas and the western ocean. \\nIn that crowd he could also spot foreigners, dressed \\ncuriously from the distant lands beyond the Vindhyas and \\nacross the seas. \\nPeople crowded to the shops of vendors selling sweet -\\nfritters, roasted meats and rice -cakes -- like flies hovering \\naround sugar syrup -- as they bought the foodstuffs. Fruits 8like banana, mango and jack were heaped in mounds \\noutside the shops. Words were not adequate to describe the \\nelegant flower kiosks. Gardenia and jasmine, fragrant \\nfrangipani, oleander, chrysanthemum and marigold, \\nchampaka and iruvatchi,  hibiscus and trumpet lilies were \\nheaped in baskets; maidens flocked around them like bees \\nbuzzing over flower groves.\\nWhen he saw the flower shops, Vandiya Devan \\nremembered the youth with the flower baskets who had \\nstood next to him. If I could meet that  young man again, \\nhow useful it would be! Perhaps he would have helped me \\nfind a comfortable place to spend this night in this city...  \\nAs he was thinking, as if to give life to his thoughts, he \\nsaw the youth walking down the street in front of him. \\nVandiya Devan hurried forward to accost him again.\\n\"Thambi, your baskets seem to be empty. What happened \\nto all the flowers? Have you sold them all?\"\\n\"I did not bring the flowers for sale. I brought them for \\nworship and decoration at the temple. I have deliver ed \\nthem at the place I serve and am now going back home,\" \\nsaid that youth.\\n\"In which temple do you serve, delivering these flowers?\"\\n\"Have you heard of the temple of Tali -kulattar?\"\\n\"Oh! The name Tanjore Tali -kulattar seems familiar. Is it \\nthe same? Is it a large temple?\"\\n\"No; it is a modest place. For some time now, only the \\ntemple of the Goddess Durga has been enjoying favor in \\nTanjore. Special worship, food offering, sacrifice, \\nfestivities, ceremony and carnival all take place there. The \\nroyal family and the Pazluvoor households have been \\npatronizing that Durga temple. There are no such \\nimportant patrons for the temple of Tali -kulattar. Not many \\npeople come to worship there...\"\\n\"You are in service to deliver flowers. Do you get paid \\nwell for this?\"\\n\"My family has subsidies for this service. From the times \\nof my grandfather our family had grants from Emperor \\nGandara Aditya for delivering this flower -service. My \\nmother and I have been continuing the practice.\"\\n\"Is the temple of Tali-kulattar built in brick, or has it been \\nrenovated in granite?\" Vandiya Devan asked the question \\nbecause he had seen several small brick -work temples \\nbeing renovated in stone and decorated with granite \\nsculpture.\\n\"It is still brick-work. I have heard that it is soon to be \\nrenovated in granite. Apparently, the Elder Pirati in \\nPazlayarai wishes to begin the renovation work as soon as \\npossible. But, ...\"\"But what? Why did you stop?\"\\n\"What is the use of repeating idle gossip? One must look \\naround in all directions before talk ing in the daytime; at \\nnighttime do not even open your mouth. This is a public \\nsquare where four roads meet! So many people around \\nus...\"\\n\"We can stand in such a spot and talk bravely of any \\nsecret. In this crowd and noise nothing we speak will be \\nheard by anyone.\"\\n\"What secrets do we have to talk about?\" asked the youth, \\neyeing Vandiya Devan with some suspicion.\\nAha! This young man is very intelligent. It would be very \\nuseful to make friends with him. I can learn about several \\nthings from him. But I sho uld not raise useless doubts in \\nhis mind, thinking such thoughts, Vandiya Devan said, \\n\"Yes, what secrets do we have? Nothing. Thambi, tonight I \\nneed a place to rest and sleep well. I have journeyed a long \\nway and am very tired. Where can I stay? Can you he lp me \\nby guiding me to a good rest house?\"\\n\"There is no dearth of places to stay in this city. There are \\nseveral inns. In fact there are many government rest houses \\nfor the use of foreign visitors. But, Sir, if you would like \\n...\"\\nBefore the youth could finish, Vandiya Devan interrupted, \\n\"Thambi, what is your name?\"\\n\"Amudan; Sendan Amudan.\"\\n\"Oh! What a sweet name! My mouth tastes the sweetness \\njust by hearing it. (Amudu meaning nectar.) Were you \\nabout to say that I could come to your house if I was \\nwilling?\"\\n\"Yes; how did you know Sir?\"\\n\"I have magic skills; that\\'s how! Where is your house?\"\\n\"Our gardens are in the suburbs, a little beyond the city \\nlimits. Our house is in the middle of the flower gardens,\" \\nsaid Sendan Amudan.\\n\"Ah! I must surely come to your house. I cannot rest in \\npeace in this city commotion tonight. Moreover, I would \\nlike to make the acquaintance of that good woman who is \\nmother to a good son like you!\"\\n\"She who gave birth to me is indeed a good woman; but \\nshe is unfortunate...\"\\n\"Dear, dear! Why do you say that? Perhaps your father \\nis...?\"9\"Yes, my father is dead. But that is not the reason. My \\nmother is unfortunate from birth. You will know when you \\nsee her. Come Sir, let us go.\"\\nThey walked for about half an hour and reached th e flower \\ngardens beyond the city limits. The fragrance of night \\nblooming flowers made Vandiya Devan\\'s head swim with \\nuncommon exhilaration.  The noise and din of the city was \\nnot heard in that pleasing grove.\\nHe could see a small tiled house in the middle  of the \\nflower garden. Two thatched huts were also seen close by. \\nTwo families who helped in the garden lived in those huts. \\nAmudan called out to one of those men and asked him to \\nfeed and water Vandiya Devan\\'s horse and tie it to a tree \\nafter grooming it.\\nHe then led his new friend into the house. As soon as he \\nsaw Amudan\\'s mother, Vandiya Devan realized her \\nmisfortune. She was mute without any speech; she was \\nalso deaf without any sense of hearing. But he saw her \\ngentle, good looking face filled with a k indness and love. \\nHer eyes shone bright with a keen intelligence. Was it not \\nthe caprice of nature to endow a superior intellect on those \\nwith some bodily handicap?\\nThat elderly woman understood that her visitor had come \\nfrom foreign parts by the signs ma de by Amudan. Her \\nexpressive face showed welcome and concern for him.\\nSoon, she placed platters of fresh banana leaves before \\nthem and served a meal. First came string -cake \\naccompanied by sweetened, freshly squeezed, coconut \\nmilk. Vandiya Devan felt that he had not eaten such \\ndelicacies in his lifetime! He ate about ten or twelve cakes \\nand drank a liter of coconut milk. Sour sauce with tubers \\nand steamed millet flour followed. He did them justice. \\nEven so, his hunger was not satiated. In the end he partook\\nof a quarter measure of cooked rice and a liter of yogurt! \\nOnly then did he rise from his platter.\\nWhile eating, he asked about and gleaned several facts \\nfrom Amudan. He enquired about who besides the \\nEmperor and his retinue lived in Tanjore Fort.\\nThe mansions of the Elder and Younger Lords of \\nPazluvoor were inside. The officers and clerks who were \\nattached to the treasury and granary lived inside because \\nthe royal treasury, counting house and granary were inside \\nthe fort. The confidante and friend of Su ndara Chozla, his \\nPrime Minister, Honorable Anirudda Brahma -raya as well \\nas the Chief Clerk of edicts and proclamations also lived in \\nthe inner fort. Soldiers guarding the fort of Tanjore under \\nthe command of the Younger Lord Pazluvoor, lived inside \\nwith their families. \\nBesides this, the streets of the goldsmiths, silversmiths, \\njewelers and dealers in precious gems and coin merchants \\nwere inside the main fort. Hundreds of clerks and writers \\nworking for the Tax Ministry under the Elder Lord Pazluvoor were also provided accommodation within. In \\naddition to all this, the famous Temple of the Goddess \\nDurga Nisumbasudhini was in one corner of the interior \\nfort. The temple priests, servants, dancing girls and \\nmusicians attached to the temple and their families, lived \\ninside near the temple.\\nHearing about all this, Vandiya Devan asked, \"Are all the \\nministers and officials inside the fort today?\"\\n\"How can everyone be inside? They will be going out and \\ncoming back in the course of their various duties. For \\nsometime now, the Honorable Prime Minister, Anirudda \\nBrahma-raya, has not been inside the fort. It is said that he \\nis gone to the Chera Kingdom. The Elder Lord of \\nPazluvoor went out four days ago. Rumor says that he has \\ngone to the central provinces beyond the Ko llidam.\"\\n\"He might be back now. Do you know?\"\\n\"The palanquin of the Young -Queen of Pazluvoor came \\nback this evening. I saw it near the gates myself. But there \\nwas no sign of Lord Pazluvoor. Perhaps he is delayed \\nsomewhere and will come back tomorrow.\"\\n\"Thambi! Does Prince Madurandaka also live inside the \\nfort?\"\\n\"Yes, his mansion is next to the Pazluvoor Palace. Isn\\'t he \\nthe bridegroom married to the daughter of the Younger \\nLord Pazluvoor?\"\\n\"Oh! Is that true? I did not know that till now!\"\\n\"Not many people know it. Because of the Emperor\\'s ill \\nhealth the wedding was not celebrated with pomp.\"\\n\"Good. Is the Prince inside the fort tonight?\"\\n\"Must be. However, Prince Madurandaka does not emerge \\nfrom the fort very often. People cannot see him commonly. \\nIt is said that he is involved in his devotions to God Shiva \\nand that he spends his time in meditation, yoga and \\nworship.\"\\n\"But he has entered into matrimony after all these years.\"\\n\"Yes, that was somewhat surprising. People also say that \\nthe mind and intentions of the bridegroom transformed \\ncompletely after the marriage! Why should we bother \\nabout that? Better not gossip about the nobility.\"\\nVandiya Devan desired to learn of several other things \\nfrom Sendan Amudan. But he did not wish to pry too \\nmuch and raise his suspicions. The friendship of such a \\namiable youth would be very useful to him. It was his \\ngood luck that he found such a convenient and comfortable \\nplace to stay in Tanjore. Why should he spoil the good \\nfortune? Moreover, tiredness of the long j ourney joined \\nforces with the sleeplessness of the previous night. His 0eyes were drowsy with sleep and exhaustion. Realizing his \\nstate, Amudan quickly made up a bed for him.\\nIn the drowsiness of sleep, towards the end, Vandiya \\nDevan\\'s mind glimpsed the gl amorous face of the Young -\\nQueen of Pazluvoor. \\nOh God! What beauty! What scintillation! His experience \\nof being tongue tied and immobile upon suddenly seeing \\nthat ravishing, enchanting face reminded him of another \\nexperience. \\nAs a child, once when he wa s walking through some \\nwoods he suddenly spied a cobra swaying its raised hood. \\nIts beauty was incomparable. The attraction was beyond \\ndescription. Vandiya Devan had not been able to take his \\neyes off the swaying hood of the snake. He could not even \\nblink his eyelids. He stood there as if hypnotized; the \\nsnake continued its swaying dance. As the snake swayed, \\nhis body began to sway in rhythm -- what would be the \\nresult, no one knew. Suddenly a mongoose pounced upon \\nthe snake. A furious contest between the t wo started. Using \\nthe chance the boy ran to his escape...\\nDear me! What a comparison! How can I equate the \\nmajestic beauty of this maid without equal in the world, \\nwith a swaying snake? Her gentle, tender face will quell all \\nhungers of those who catch a g limpse of it! ... I am going \\nto meet her tomorrow! How sweet her voice! Her beauty is \\nextraordinary. But, how about the other maid whom I saw \\nat the astrologer\\'s house and on the banks of the Arisil? ... \\nHer face too, was radiant. It too glowed with a love liness. \\nBoth are exquisite beauties; but what a difference! That \\nhas dignity and decorum; while this has allure and \\nglamour.\\nThus, while his heart was comparing the two attractive \\nwomen he had met recently, a third maid intervened. That \\nmerciless tyrant, the Empress of Sleep took charge of him \\ncompletely.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 24: ' A Cuckoo And A Crow\\nVandiya Devan slept through the night like a log and woke \\nup only after sunrise in the morning. Even after waking, he \\nwas lying down without the will to get up. The light breeze \\nblew briskly, leaves of the creepers and trees rubbed \\nagainst each other making a swishing murmur. With that \\nbackground drone, a young voice was melodiously singing \\na pleasing Thevaram poem composed by the Saint Sundara \\nMurti. \\nO Lord of golden hued body with a tiger skin draped around the waist;Upon matted locks, burnished red, you wear the shining crescent!\\nOn hearing the song, Vandiya Devan opened his eyes and \\nlooked out. Outside, in the garden he saw tall konnai trees(the bignonia family) draped with wreaths of golden \\nyellow flowers! Sendan Amudan held a large flower tote in \\none hand and a long bamboo pole in the other. While he \\nsang, his hands plucked the yellow flowers with the \\nharvest pole. He appeared neatly dress ed, having risen and \\nbathed early, his forehead was adorned with broad ashen \\nmarks making him appear like another ever youthful \\nMarkandeya, that ardent devotee of Shiva.\\nVandiya Devan rose from his bed thinking about \\nAmudan\\'s unfortunate mother who could not hear the \\nmelodious song of her son. He wondered why he too \\nshould not cultivate a pleasant garden, serve in temples \\nand lead a calm and quiet life. Why should he bear sword \\nand spear and wander from place to place? Why should he \\nroam about in readiness  to kill or be killed by others? --\\nsuch thoughts jostled his mind. \\nBut soon, his heart cheered up. Can everyone in the world \\nbe meek and gentle like Sendan Amudan? There are many \\nwho are thieves, robbers, and conniving evil -doers who \\nharm the guileless folk. A government was needed to \\ncontrol such people and establish some law and order. \\nKings and ministers were essential to form such \\ngovernments. Velaikara Battalions were essential to \\nprotect such kings. Messengers like himself to carry letters \\nto such kings were also needed... Yes, today I must \\nsomehow or other meet Emperor Sundara Chozla. I must \\npresent myself before the Elder Lord of Pazluvoor returns; \\nif the old man gets back I may not have an opportunity.\\nVandiya Devan went to the lotus pond in the  garden for a \\nswim and bath. He came back refreshed and dressed \\nhimself neatly with clean cloth and correct ornaments. He \\nwas going to present himself to the Emperor -- shouldn\\'t he \\nbe attired properly? Perhaps it was that thought that made \\nhim dress carefully; or, maybe it was the idea that he was \\nsoon going to see the Young -Queen of Pazluvoor once \\nagain, which occupied his thoughts! None can tell.\\nAfter the early morning meal, Sendan Amudan was ready \\nto depart with his baskets to deliver the flowers at t he \\ntemple before the morning service. Vandiya Devan went \\nwith him with the idea of meeting the Emperor. Both \\nfriends walked.\\nVandiya Devan had already decided not to take his horse \\nto the fort. It was important to let the horse rest \\ncompletely. Soon he ma y have to use it for some hurried \\njourney. Who knows? It was better to leave the horse \\nbehind, in the garden. Till they reached the main gateway \\nof the fort, he talked to Amudan and found out several \\nother pieces of information.\\nWhen Vallavarayan had aske d, \"Do you have any other \\nfamily besides your mother?\" Sendan had replied, \"I do \\nhave some. An elder sister and an elder brother of my \\nmother. Her elder sister died some time ago. Her brother is \\nheadman of a small community attached to the Kuzlagar \\ntemple at Kodi Karai. My uncle is also the keeper of the 1lighthouse on that coast. In the nights he lights the fire atop \\nthe tower and is in charge of other such things. He has one \\nson and one daughter. That daughter, ...\" Amudan \\nhesitated.\\n\"That daughter? What about her?\"\\n\"Nothing. There is something peculiar about members of \\nmy family. Some of them are born dumb while others are \\nblessed with a most pleasing voice for they sing very \\nwell.\"\\n\"Your uncle\\'s daughter is not dumb I hope?\" enquired \\nVandiya Devan.\\n\"No. Not at all.\"\\n\"That means she can sing very well! Can she sing better \\nthan you?\"\\n\"Ridiculous! Your question is foolish -- like asking `Can \\nthe Cuckoo sing better than the Crow?\\' When Poonkuzlali \\nsings, the Ocean King will stop throwing his noisy waves \\nand listen quietly. Sheep and cattle will listen \\nspellbound...\"\\n\"Is your cousin called Poonkuzlali? What a pretty name!\"\\n\"Is it just her name that\\'s pretty!\"\\n\"She must be ravishing. Otherwise, will you be so \\ncaptivated?\"\\n\"The spotted deer and the gorge ous peacock must beg at \\nher feet for beauty. Divine maids like Indrani and Rathi \\nmust perform penance for several births to become as \\nlovely as her.\"\\nVandiya Devan realized that Sendan Amudan was not \\nfully involved in service at the temple. \"That means sh e is \\na suitable bride for you. If she is your maternal uncle\\'s \\ndaughter, you have all the rights for her hand? When is the \\nwedding?\" \\n\"I will never say that I deserve her. In no way am I \\nqualified for her. If, like the olden days a competition was \\narranged to select a groom for her, all the kings of the \\nworld will compete for her hand. Divine beings might \\ncome forward seeking her hand like they did for Princess \\nDamayanti of the myths. Such things may not happen \\nthese days.\"\\n\"So? Are you saying that you wi ll refuse even if she is \\nwilling to marry you?\"\\n\"Quite silly! If the God I worship appears before me and \\nasks `Will you come with me to the heavens just as you \\nare, like Saint Sundara? Or, will you remain on this earth \\nwith Poonkuzlali?\\' -- I will say that I would stay back with \\nPoonkuzlali. But, what is the use of my saying it?\"\"Why not? When you wish it the marriage is almost \\nsettled, isn\\'t it? Does everyone arrange marriages after \\nasking the bride? For example look at Elder Lord \\nPazluvoor -- he has married a young maid after his sixty -\\nfifth year! Was that marriage performed with that lady\\'s \\nconsent?\"\\n\"My friend! Those are affairs of nobility. Why should we \\ndiscuss it? More important, let me give you a warning hint. \\nYou are about to enter Tanjore. Do n ot utter anything \\nabout the Lords of Pazluvoor inside the fort. It may be \\nunsafe to do so.\"\\n\"Why Thambi, you are thoroughly frightening me!\"\\n\"I am telling you the truth. Really, nowadays it is both \\nthose Lords of Pazluvoor that rule the Chozla Kingdom. \\nThere is no authority higher than theirs.\"\\n\"Even the Emperor is not more powerful?!\"\\n\"The Emperor lies on his sickbed. People say that he does \\nnot cross the lines drawn by those men of Pazluvoor. They \\nsay that he does not even listen to the words of his o wn \\nsons!\"\\n\"Is that true?! The domination of the Pazluvoor Lords must \\nbe quite strong. They were not so powerful even two years \\nago?\"\\n\"No; after the Emperor came to Tanjore, the power of \\nthose fellows has gone beyond limit. There is no one to \\nquestion them. Rumor has it that even the Honorable \\nAnirudda Brahma-raya left in disgust and went away to the \\nPandiya Kingdom.\"\\n\"Why did the Emperor move to Tanjore from Pazlayarai? \\nDo you know Thambi?\"\\n\"I can tell you what I have heard. Three years ago, Veera -\\npandiya died in the battlefield. It was reported that the \\nChozla armies committed several atrocities in the Pandiya \\nlands at that time. War means anything can happen; \\nMadurai is now under Chozla rule. But, it is said that some \\nof the men loyal to Veera -pandiya have sworn vengeance; \\nthey conspire together. The Lords of Pazluvoor felt that \\nthey would not be able to guard the Emperor from such \\nassassins at Pazlayarai. They asked him to move to \\nTanjore. The fortress here is stronger. Its guard and safety \\nis more efficient. Besides, the doctors felt that Tanjore was \\na better place than Pazlayarai to treat the Emperor\\'s \\nillness.\"\\n\"Everybody talks about the Emperor\\'s ill health! But no \\none says what is wrong with him!\"\\n\"Why? It is well known. The Emperor has paralysis ; he \\nhas lost the use of both his legs.\"2\"Oh! Can he not walk at all?\"\\n\"He cannot walk, neither can he ride upon a horse or \\nelephant. He is bed ridden. They can carry him from place \\nto place in a palanquin or litter. Even that, I believe is very \\npainful. Therefore, the Emperor never leaves the palace. \\nSome say that for the past few months even his mind is \\ndeteriorating\"\\n\"Oh! What a pity!\"\\n\"Don\\'t feel pity, my friend! The Pazluvoor men may think \\nit to be treason and put you in prison!\"\\nPazluvoor! Lord Pazluvoor! Men of Pazluvoor! \\nEverywhere, to whomever I talk, their name crops up. \\nHowever capable they are, why has so much power been \\ngiven to them? The treasury, the granary, Tanjore City \\nguard, policing and information gathering in the nation, \\ntaxation -- everything seems to be under their control. The \\nEmperor should not have let that happen. Because of all \\nthese powers, they have started scheming against the \\nEmperor! How long will their plots be successful? I must \\ndo my best to thwart their plans. If pos sible I must also \\nwarn the Emperor.\\nBy now they had come to the main entrance of Tanjore \\nFort. Sendan Amudan parted from his new friend and \\nwalked towards the temple of Tali -kulattar. Vandiya \\nDevan neared that fort with several dream castles of his \\nown!\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 25: ' Inside The Fort\\nThe signet ring with the palmtree emblem had miraculous \\npowers like the magical rings in fairy tales!\\nIn that morning hour, various people -- vendors of milk, \\ncurds and other dairy products, fruit and vegetable sellers, \\nbutchers, farmers, others engaged in various trades, clerks \\nand accountants, petty officials and others -- were trying to \\nenter the fort. The officious gatekeepers were letting them \\nin, one by one, through a small wicket gate placed on o ne \\nof the big doors. The guards stood around with cocky \\ninsolence.\\nBut, as soon as our young hero showed the palm tree \\nsignet ring, they became very reverent; they even opened \\none of the large doors to let him enter. Vandiya Devan \\nentered the fort of Tanj ore.\\nOh yes! We do not know the auspicious moment in which \\nhe set foot in that great fort, but we do know that several \\nsignificant events followed that entry. We could even \\nconsider that moment as one of the most important \\nmoments in the history of South India!For some time after entering that fort, Vandiya Devan was \\nimmersed in astonish-ment. Kanchi City (from where he \\ncame) was the capital of the ancient Pallava Empire. It had \\nwithstood the attack of several enemies. The buildings, \\nmansions and palaces in that city were now badly \\nmaintained, dilapidated ruins. Of course many of them \\nwere well sculpted, architecturally beautiful. But several \\nparts of that city were in ruins. After Aditya Karikala took \\nover, he had renovated some of the public buildings a nd \\npalaces. These new structures looked like isolated sprigs of \\nfresh shoots on a dying tree. In facts they made the \\ndilapidation more obvious. But this Tanjore!?\\nTanjore was quite the opposite thing. Everything looked \\nnew. New palaces, new buildings, new  temples. The \\nwhite-washed mansions interspersed with buildings of \\nbrick baked of red earth shone like some jewel, set with a \\ncluster of rubies enhanced by pearls and diamonds. Trees \\nin the gardens and by the roadside had grown luxuriously \\ntall, nourished by that fertile red-dust. Coconut and areca \\nnut palms; ashoka cypress, laurels, spreading banyan, fig \\nand sacred ficus; jack, mango and neem -- they painted a \\npicture of varying hues of emerald. That greenery was \\npleasing to the eye and joyous to the heart . A new city \\nbuilt by an architect of illusion. I feel new excitement \\nwhen I enter this new city; my heart fills with \\nunexplainable pride!\\nVandiya Devan who had seen the fuss and fret in letting \\npeople enter inside had surmised that the inner city would \\nbe empty. But it was quite contrary: all the streets were \\ncrowded with hustle and bustle. Horses, and chariots \\nyoked with horses rushed past noisily. Bells -- tied around \\nthe necks of elephants which walked slowly, gracefully \\nlike tiny, black, moving hilloc ks -- tinkled all around.  \\nVendors selling flowers, fruit, milk, fish and other edibles  \\ncalled out their wares and raised a huge din. Huge drums \\nboomed and large bells tolled periodically announcing the \\npassing hours. The gentle breeze carried the melody of \\nmusical instruments and voices of young men and women \\nraised in song. Everything was festive like one big \\ncarnival.\\nThis is a city! This is the capital of an empire that is \\ngrowing and spreading day by day! Vandiya Devan did not \\nwish to let anyone know  that he was a newcomer to that \\nexquisite city. If he asked the way of anyone they would \\nlook him up and down and ask arrogantly, \"Are you new to \\nthis town?\" -- They may even think him to be an \\nuncivilized villager if he asked the way to the royal palace. \\nTherefore, he should somehow find his way without asking \\nanyone and reach the palace. It may not be difficult.\\nWherever he looked he could see mansions festooned with \\nbunting and crowned by high flying pennants and flags. \\nThe flags fought the swift breeze  and raised a \"Chat, pat\" \\nnoise. Tiger-flags and palmtree- flags were more profuse. \\nHe saw one huge flag emblazoned with a rampant tiger, \\nflying sky high, rising above all the others. That must be 3the Emperor\\'s palace, thought Vandiya Devan \\nVallavarayan as he began walking in that direction. He \\nthought of what he must do next.\\nThe first, important task is to present myself to the \\nEmperor and personally deliver the letter and the verbal \\nmessages conveyed by Prince Aditya. It may not be \\npossible to see the Emperor without the Younger Lord \\nPazluvoor\\'s permission. How can I obtain that permission? \\nGod helped me enter the fort. But, can I be complacent, \\nthinking that God\\'s grace will aid me till the end? I must \\nconnive something to manage entry into the palace t o meet \\nthe Emperor. What is the strategy to adopt? Oh my clever \\nbrain! Descendant of generations of illustrious Vaanar\\'s! \\nThink of something! Polish up your imagination. Get to \\nwork! Imagination is essential; not just for writers and \\npoets. Fellows like me entangled in such political turmoil \\nalso need plenty of imagination. Let me think...\\nHe had already made sure that the Elder Lord Pazluvoor \\nhad not returned to the fort. As soon as he come in he had \\nasked one of the gatekeepers, \"Why man, has Lord \\nPazluvoor come back?\"\\n\"Whom are you asking about, Thambi? The Younger Lord \\nis in the palace!\"\\n\"Don\\'t I know that! I am asking about the Elder Lord who \\nhad journeyed to the central provinces.\"\\n\"Oh! Was it to the central provinces that the Elder Lord \\nwent? I didn\\'t know that! The Young -Queen\\'s palanquin \\nreturned last night. The Elder Lord has not returned yet. \\nWe got word that he will probably return tonight,\" said the \\ngatekeeper.\\nThat was good news. He must somehow meet the Emperor \\nbefore the Elder Lord Pazluv oor returns. How ...? An idea \\noccurred to him. The worry lines vanished immediately \\nand a mischievous smile and joy blossomed on his face.\\nHe did not have to wander much to reach the Emperor\\'s \\npalace. He kept walking in the direction of the large tiger -\\nflag. Soon he reached the portals of the large palace. What \\na wonderful building. A palace comparable to that of the \\nKing of Gods; a palace like that of legendary Vikramaditya \\nof Ujjain! How exquisite is the carving on these portals? \\nThe horses with raised f orelegs, carved on the pillars, seem \\nto be ready to leap forward!\\nSeveral roads from all directions came to meet in a large \\nplaza in front of that palace. At the head of each of these \\nstreets two horsemen and two footmen stood guard. People \\nwalking about the streets turned back without coming near \\nthem. Some persons stood near them to stare at the palace \\nportal and the big flag before they turned back. If the \\npeople crowded around too long, the guards made signs to \\ndisperse them. Even those who gathered in  groups talked \\nsoftly, whispering to each other. Vandiya Devan did not \\nhesitate like these others. He walked forward with pride and confidence. As soon as he stepped into the plaza two \\nhorsemen barred his way. The horses stood nose to nose \\nand long lances crossed in front of him. The footmen came \\nnear him.\\nVandiya Devan showed them his magic ring. That was it; \\nthe lances parted and the horses moved away. But three \\nmen examined the ring, one after the other. Finally the \\nman who seemed to be in charge said, \"OK, let him in.\" \\nVandiya Devan walked in cockily.\\nNow what? How many other guards like this? Where \\nwould I find the Younger Lord Pazluvoor? Should I ask? \\nWhom shall I ask? -- Can I manage to see the Emperor \\nwithout his permission?  Where would I find the  Emperor \\non his sick bed in this huge mansion! ... \\nCatching sight of a group of men behind him, he turned \\naround. Yes; about ten to fifteen men came in a group to \\nhesitate in front of the guards. Those men wore scarves of \\nrich silken cloth. They were dre ssed in pearl necklaces, \\ngolden anklets and eardrops. Some had adorned their \\nforehead with horizontal ashen lines. Others wore marks of \\nsandal paste, red kumkum powder or aromatic civet spots.  \\nOh! Don\\'t these men look like poets and bards! Yes they \\nwere a group of bards!\\nOne of the guards, their leader, was saying, \"The bards and \\npoet kings have come; let them enter.\" He then ordered \\none of the footmen: \"Lead these people to the audience \\nchamber of the Younger Lord Pazluvoor.\"\\n\"Masters! Poets! if you rec eive any presents or rewards \\nplease come back this way -- and remember me! If you do \\nnot get any awards you can leave by the other gate!\" \\nEverybody laughed at these words of the guard.\\nVandiya Devan who had hesitated on the steps to listen to \\nthis conversation felt \"The fruit has slipped into the \\ncream!\" He decided to follow the poets and get to the \\npresence of the Younger Lord Pazluvoor. He did not have \\nto ask anyone. Then comes my cleverness; my goodluck \\nwill surely help, he thought. He quietly mingled i nto that \\ngroup of poets.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 26: ' Danger! Danger!\\nVandiya Devan entered the audience chamber ahead of the \\npoets. He guessed that the stately person seated on the high \\nthrone was the Younger Lord of Pazluvoor. Several \\npersons stood around him in deferential postures with \\nhands folded and lips sealed. One person stood with \\nseveral bundles of palm -leafs, letters which had arrived \\nthat day. The accountant waited on the side with his books \\nto render the previous day\\'s accounts. Lead ers of the guard \\npatiently awaited his orders for the day. Servants lingered 4in readiness to execute any order that was given. A couple \\nof maids stood behind the throne waving the white -whisk \\nfans. Another fellow stood ready with the box of betel \\nleaves and condiments.\\nEven Vandiya Devan, who had no dearth of self -esteem or \\npride, approached the Younger Lord Pazluvoor with some \\nhumility and timidity. The younger brother seemed even \\nmore imposing than the elder. Upon sighting our gallant, \\nhe asked with a cheerful face, \"Thambi, who are you? \\nWhere have you come from?\"\\nThe usually harsh mein of the Younger Lord Pazluvoor \\nalways brightened upon seeing brave young men. He was \\neager to recruit fearless young men from all over the \\ncountry into his company of guar ds. \\n\"Commander! Sir! I come from Kanchi. The Prince has \\nsent me with letters.\" Vandiya Devan answered in a \\ndeferential voice. Upon hearing the word Kanchi, the \\nCommander\\'s face darkened.\\n\"What? What did you say?\" he asked again.\\n\"I have come from Kanch i City with letters from the \\nPrince.\"\\n\"Where are they? Give them here!\" he commanded with \\ncontempt, but his face showed some disquiet.\\nVandiya Devan drew the letters from his waist pouch, but \\nstill reverently, said, \"Commander, the letter is for the \\nEmperor!\"\\nThe Younger Lord Pazluvoor did not care about that, he \\nsnatched the roll of palm leaves from him and looked at \\nthe seals eagerly. He then gave the roll to a subordinate, \\nasking him to read it. \\nAfter listening, he mumbled, \"Nothing new!\" He seemed \\ninvolved in his own thoughts.\\n\"Commander! The letters I brought,\" started Vandiya \\nDevan.\\n\"What about the letters? I shall give them to the Emperor.\"\\n\"No! Sir! The Prince asked me to deliver them personally \\ninto the hands of the Emperor.\"\\n\"Oh! You don\\'t trust me? Did Prince Aditya tell you that?\" \\nasked the Commander of Tanjore with anger clouding his \\nface.\\n\"The Prince did not say anything like that. Your elder \\nbrother ordered it.\"\\n\"What? What? Where did you see the Elder?\"\"I stayed in the house of Ka damboor Sambuvaraya for a \\nnight on the way. I met him there. He sent me, with this \\nsignet ring...\"\\n\"Ah! Why didn\\'t you say so in the first place? Did you stay \\nthe night at Kadamboor? Who else had come?\"\\n\"Several dignitaries from Mazluvoor, the Central \\nProvinces, Thiru-munai-padi and elsewhere had come...\"\\n\"Wait! Stop! I must talk to you at leisure. First, you can go \\nin and deliver this letter to the Emperor and come back. \\nThose Tamil poets will be here soon and if you give them \\na chance they will not sto p their blabberings. Come back \\nhere. Hey! Who is there ...? take this man to the Emperor\\'s \\nbed chamber!\" ordered the Younger Lord of Pazluvoor.\\nVandiya Devan followed the servant into the inner \\ncourtyards of that palace.\\nFor some time now, the throne of the Chozla Empire --\\nbound by the roaring seas on three sides -- had been \\ntransformed into a sickbed. Emperor Paranthaka Sundara \\nChozla was reclining on that bed. Though he had delegated \\nall affairs of the state to his officials and ministers, \\noftentimes he had to receive particularly indispensable \\npersons on certain important occasions. These days he was \\nmostly under the care of his physicians. But, it was \\nessential for the welfare of the empire that his ministers, \\narmy generals, captains, and the leaders of the Velaikara \\nBattalion should come to his presence daily.\\nWhen Vandiya Devan saw the emaciated, sickly \\nappearance of the Emperor -- who had performed \\ncelebrated deeds of valor in various battles and acquired \\nfame as a brave warrior, who was called `Su ndara Chozla, \\nthe Handsome One\\' by all the country and nation, who was \\nrenowned to be like the God of Love in looks -- he could \\nnot utter a single word. His eyes filled with tears. He \\napproached closer to the bed and bowed low; then \\nsubmitted the letter.\\nThe Emperor began opening the letter as he asked in a \\nfaint voice, \"Where are you coming from? Whose letter is \\nthis?\"\\n\"My Majesty! My Lord! I come from Kanchi City; I bring \\nthis letter from Prince Aditya.\" Vandiya Devan spoke the \\nwords with a trembling to ngue.\\nImmediately, the Emperor\\'s face brightened. The Empress, \\nVanama Devi, daughter of Thirukovalur Malayaman, was \\nseated near him. He looked at her saying, \"Devi, your son \\nhas sent a letter!\" he began reading.\\n\"Ah! The Prince has built a Golden Palace at Kanchi! He \\nwants me and you to come and live there for a while!\" \\nsaying this, the Emperor\\'s face became sadder than before.5\"Devi, look at this activity of your son! My grandfather, \\nthat famous Emperor Paranthaka, collected all the gold in \\nthe palace vaults to cover the roof of the temple at \\nChidambaram making it a Golden Temple! No person born \\nin our clan built a golden palace for their personal \\ndwelling! They considered the building of temples to be \\nmore important than the building of palaces. But loo k at \\nwhat this Karikala has done? Ah! How can I atone this \\noutrage against the Gods?\" said the Emperor.\\nDevi\\'s face, which had cheered up on hearing that there \\nwas a letter from her son, now became more melancholy \\nthan before. She could not give any reply .\\nAt that instant Vandiya Devan gathered courage and \\nboldness. \"My Lord! There isn\\'t anything so very wrong in \\nwhat your esteemed son has done! He has done the right \\nthing. Are not his mother and father the first Gods for a \\nson?  So, is it not right that your son should build a Golden \\nPalace for your dwelling?\" he asked.\\nSundara Chozla smiled, \"Thambi, who are you? Do I know \\nyou? You seem very intelligent. You talk very cleverly. \\nEven if his parents are Gods to their son, they are not that \\nfor others! Golden temples should be built only for Gods \\nworshipped by one and all!\"\\n\"My Lord! His father is God to the son; the king is God to \\nall his subjects. The religious texts says that a monarch \\npossesses the qualities of God. Therefore, it is quite \\nappropriate to build a golden palace for you.\"\\nSundara Chozla looked at his wife, Malayaman\\'s daughter, \\nonce again, \"Devi! Look at this boy; see how resourceful \\nhe is?  If our Aditya has the council of such men we do not \\nhave to be so concerned about him. We need not worry \\nabout his heedless nature,\" he said.\\nHe then looked at Vandiya Devan, \"Thambi, Whether it is \\nright or wrong about building the Golden Palace at Kanchi, \\none thing is clear. It is not possible for me to come to \\nKanchi now. You are seeing my condition.  I am \\ncompletely bed ridden like this. It is not possible to \\nundertake a long journey. Aditya must come here to see \\nme. We too wish to see him. Come back tomorrow. I shall \\nhave a letter prepared in reply,\" said the Emperor.\\nVandiya Devan, could hear the n oise of several people \\ncoming down the corridor. Oh yes! That group of bards \\nand poets is coming here. The Younger Lord Pazluvoor is \\nperhaps coming with them. Then, I may not be able to \\ndisclose to the Emperor all that I have to narrate to him. I \\nmust briefly tell him everything right now. Vandiya Devan \\nmade this decision within a few seconds; \"My Lord! Sire! I \\nseek your grace, please listen to my petition. It is important \\nthat you leave Tanjore. Danger surrounds you here. \\nDanger! Danger!\" said Vandiya Deva n.As he was speaking these words the Younger Lord of \\nPazluvoor entered the chamber. The bards and poets \\nfollowed him.\\nThe last few words uttered by Vandiya Devan fell in the \\nears of the Commander of Tanjore. Anger flashed brightly \\non his face.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 27: ' Court Poets\\nWatch out! Watch out! Here come the great poets! The \\nbest of the bards!

They who know the \\nins and outs of Thirukural, the cannon of Tamil culture! \\nThey who know the grammar of all litera ture. They who \\nknow how to compose verse with originality! Think of \\nthis: The rolls and rolls of palm leaves used up by each one \\nof them would feed millions and millions of hungry \\ntermites for years and years to come!\\nThe whole group of the great poets ca me into the chamber \\nof Emperor Sundara Chozla.\\n\"Long life! Long life! Long live Emperor Sundara Chozla \\nwho rules all the seven worlds under one canopy. Long life \\nto the Lord who `Brought down the fever (passion) of the \\nPandiya\\'. Long live the patron of th e bards. The benevolent \\nLord of the poets, Long life to him. Long live the honored \\ngrandson of that great Paranthaka who loved poets!\" They \\ncheered as one man in praise of the monarch.\\nSundara Chozla did not seem to appreciate the cheering or \\nthe commotion too much. Nevertheless he hid his feelings \\nand unmindful of his ailment he tried to rise and welcome \\nthem. The Younger Lord of Pazluvoor came forward \\nimmediately, saying, \"My Lord! These poets have come to \\ngreet you and honor you, they have not come here  to \\ntrouble you. Please do not try to rise and trouble yourself.\"\\n\"Yes; yes! Oh King of Kings, Oh best among Emperors! \\nWe have not come here to trouble you in the least bit!\" \\nsaid the chief of poets, Nallavan Sattanar.\\n\"I am happy to see you all after al l these days. Please, \\nwon\\'t you all be seated? I shall be glad to hear some of \\nyour verses before you go!\" spoke the Emperor who was \\nfond of Tamil literature.\\nAll of them sat down on a rich, jewelled carpet spread on \\nthe floor. Thinking it to be a good op portunity, our \\ndauntless Vallavarayan also sat down in their midst. He \\ndid not feel like leaving before he had stated all his 6thoughts to the Emperor. He sat down hoping for another \\nopportunity to be private with the monarch.\\nThe Younger Lord of Pazluvoor  noticed him. His \\nmoustache twitched. He considered throwing the fellow \\nout. But then he decided that it was better to let the fellow \\nremain right under his watchful eyes. Therefore, he \\npretended ignorance of the fellow hiding amidst the group \\nof poets. The Commander decided to drag him out after the \\nbards had left and find out what the fellow had been saying \\nto the Emperor. His words \"Danger! Danger!\" were still \\nreverberating in his ears.\\n\"Dear Poets! It has been a long time since I heard some \\nTamil verse. My ears are hungry for Tamil poems. Have \\nany of you brought any new poems?\" asked Emperor \\nSundara Chozla.\\nOne of the bards stood up, \"My Lord! I come from the \\nmonastery named in your honor, Sundara Chozla Perum -\\npalli which is in Ulaga Puram. All the bud dhists in this \\nnation commend your benevolence to a buddhist \\nmonastery though you are of the Saiva sect. The monks \\nand abbots are concerned about your ill health and we \\noffer prayers  for your welfare and good health. I have \\nwritten some verses in this con nection. If permitted I \\nwould like to recite these.\"\\n\"Please! Do repeat them. I am waiting to listen.\"\\nThe bard then sang some verses beginning with the \\nfollowing lines:-\\nOh ye good soul, who found enlightenment under the Bo tree! May you bless Sundara Chozla, monarch of growing Nandipuri, *\\nMay he grow in prosperity, benevolence and in good looks and health,To live with fame on this good earth.\\n* Nandipuri was another name for Pazlayarai\\nAfter hearing the poem all the poets showed appreciation \\nwith words like \"Good, good, well done!\"\\n\"It is surprising that the buddhists are so thankful about the \\nhelp!\" said one of the poets who was a fanatic Saiva.\\n\"Yes, it is quite a surprising thing. My service to the \\nmonastery at Ulaga Puram was very meager. Do I deserve \\nsuch praise for that?\"\\n\"Who among those who have enjoyed the benevolence and \\nkindness of the Emperor will not praise his name? Even \\nIndra the King of Gods, Surya the Sun and the Great Lord \\nShiva have enjoyed his generosity!\" said another poet.\\nWith a smile playing upon his lips Sundara Chozla asked, \\n\"How is that? The King of the Gods and the Sun God? \\nEven Lord Shiva? Why should they be beholden to me?\"\\n\"Permit me to repeat a verse to that effect,\" said the poet.When the monarch nodded assent,  he opened the leaves of \\nthe book in his hand and started reading the following \\npoem:-\\nAn elephant he did present for Lord Indra to mount;Seven horses did he give, for that flame -bodied Lord, creator of the day;A palanquin for that good Lord Shiva and h is gentle spouse;Such is the benevolence of Sundara Chozla With whom on this earth can we compare his glory?\\nAfter the poet had recited these lines everybody in the \\ngroup applauded, by clapping their hands and by saying \\nwords like \"Aha! Aha! Good! Good! \"\\nWith a pleased expression the Emperor asked, \"Can any of \\nyou explain this poem in detail?\"\\nSeveral of them rose at the same time. Seeing the chief \\npoet Sattanar the others sat down. Nallavan Sattanar then \\nexplained the poem as follows: -\\n\"Once upon a time, long long ago, there was a war \\nbetween the King of the Devas and the Demon Vritta. In \\nthat war the great elephant named Iravatha which belonged \\nto Lord Indra died. Indra was looking around for another \\nelephant comparable to that great beast. Finally h e came to \\nEmperor Sundara Chozla of Pazlayarai and begged for `An \\nelephant comparable to Iravatha.\\' The monarch replied, `I \\ndo not have any elephants comparable to Iravatha but I \\nhave several better ones.\\' After saying this he took Indra to \\nhis elephant stable. The Lord of the Gods saw the \\nthousands of beasts standing there like little hillocks and \\nwas confused, `Which one shall I choose?\\' Seeing his \\nbewilderment, Sundara Chozla selected one good elephant \\nand presented it to Indra. `How am I going to contro l this \\nrogue elephant. Even my weapons the thunderbolts, may \\nnot be sufficient!\\' thought Indra with fright; on seeing that, \\nthe Emperor presented him with a good ankush (elephant \\ngoad) for controlling the new elephant given to him.\\n\"Later at one time, there was a terrible battle between the \\nGod Surya of the radiant red rays who spreads light over \\nall the world and the Demon Raagu, who causes eclipses. \\nRaagu tried to swallow the creator of day and night; but he \\ncould not do so: the brilliant light of the Su n God \\nconsumed his body. However the seven colorful horses \\nyoked to the Sun God\\'s chariot were killed by the poisons \\nspilt by the demon. While the Sun stood still, wondering \\nhow he could resume his daily passage across the skies, \\nSundara Chozla considered his helplessness and presented \\nhim with seven new horses. `Please yoke these horses to \\nyour chariot and spread the grace of your brilliance to all \\nliving beings\\' prayed the monarch. The Sun God acclaimed \\nthe earthly King who was a descendant of his clan i. e. \\nSurya Vamsa (Sun Kings).\\n\"Several years ago the wedding of Lord Shiva and Parvathi \\nDevi was celebrated with pomp in the mountains of \\nKailasa.  The friends and relatives of the bride had come \\nwith several costly presents. But they had forgotten to \\nbring a palanquin for the wedding procession. They 7whispered amongst themselves `There is nothing but this \\nbull available to carry the bride and groom in procession. \\nWhat can we do now?\\' Sundara Chozla heard this and \\nordered his servants to bring his ivory pala nquin inlaid \\nwith pearls, from the carriage house. He then offered it \\nwith much devotion, as a present at the wedding of the \\ngreat God Shiva. \\n\"Who else is there in this wide world surrounded by the \\nseas, to compare with such a benevolent, gracious \\nmonarch?\"\\nSundara Chozla who was listening to all this, burst out \\nlaughing. The Emperor who had been suffering with \\nillness had not laughed like that for a long time. On \\nhearing his laughter and seeing his mirth even the Empress \\nVanama Devi smiled; the maids in  the palace and even the \\ndoctors in the chamber smiled.\\nThe Commander of Tanjore, Younger Lord Pazluvoor, had \\nbeen standing apart all this time. Now he came forward \\nsaying, \"My Lord! I have committed a grave crime, please \\nforgive my mistake and pardon me! \"\\n\"Is it the Commander? What crime did you commit? Why \\nshould you be forgiven? Perhaps you seized the elephant \\nand horses that I gave to the Gods and brought them back? \\nDid you confiscate the palanquin given to Shiva? --\\nBecause these things were not prop erly accounted for? Ah \\nyes! You are quite capable of doing that!\" said Sundara \\nChozla with a voice chocking with laughter. The poets \\nlaughed with the Emperor. Vandiya Devan laughed louder \\nthan everyone else. The Younger Lord Pazluvoor noticed \\nhis laughter and looked at him with blazing eyes.\\nThe Commander then turned to the Emperor and said, \\n\"King of Kings! My mistake was just this: I had been \\npreventing persons like these poets from coming to your \\npresence all these days. I followed the orders of the pala ce \\ndoctors. But now I realize my mistake. These poets have \\nmade you cheerful. You have laughed loudly after \\nlistening to their poems! Smiles blossomed on the faces of \\nthe Udaya Pirati, (Queen Consort) and even the maids \\nupon seeing your mirth. Wasn\\'t it my  mistake to not let \\nsuch people who could cause such happiness into your \\npresence?\"\\n\"You said the right thing Commander! Do you realize it at \\nleast now? I keep telling you don\\'t bother about the \\ndoctors.\"\\nThe palace doctor tried to mumble some reply in a  reverent \\nmanner, Sundara Chozla made a sign to stop him and then \\nlooked at the bards. \"Does anyone here know who \\ncomposed this exquisite verse? If anyone knows, please let \\nme know!\" said the Emperor.\\nNallavan Sattanar replied, \"King of Kings that is what  we \\ndo not know. All of us have been trying to find out that! If \\nwe knew, we would crown that poet with the title `Emperor of Poets\\' and carry him in procession around the \\ncity. We have not been able to find that poet\\'s identity.\"\\n\"There is nothing surpri sing about that. I am sure that the \\ngreat poet who can stuff that many untruths in four lines \\nwill hesitate to come forward!\" \\nWhen the Emperor said these words, all the bards felt \\ntotally dejected; their faces fell as if swallowed by an \\neclipse! None of them knew a reply for this comment! At \\nthis point, our hero Vandiya Devan stood up boldly and \\nsaid, \"My Lord! We should not dismiss this verse \\ncompletely as absolute untruth. When common folks utter \\nwords that are not factual, we call them lies; when peopl e \\ninvolved in the conduct of nations say such things, it is \\nknown as political shrewdness; when poets say such \\nthings, it is imagination, creativity, alliteration, prosody, \\nmeter, rhyme, lyric.\"\\nAll the poets now turned to him, saying, \"Well said, Good! \\nGood!\"\\nThe Emperor also looked at him, scrutinizing his face: \\n\"Oh! Aren\\'t you the messenger who brought letters from \\nKanchi? Clever! Well parried argument! Good rebuttal!\" \\npraised the Emperor. \\nHe then looked at the group of poets and said, \"Though it \\nwas a good poem, there is no need to find its author and \\ncrown him with titles. I know the poet who wrote this \\nverse. He is already burdened with the weight of the \\njeweled crown of the Chozla Empire. Titles such as \\n`Emperor of the Three Worlds\\', `Emperor of t he Good \\nEarth and the Seven Worlds\\' are already being borne by \\nthat King of Poets.\"\\nAnd if this author says that the poets who heard his words \\ndrowned in the ocean of surprise and struggled -- readers \\nshould not disregard it as lies. It is the author\\'s \\nimagination, lyric, comparison, raphsody. You must accept \\nit as some such grammatic convention of literature!\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 28: ' Iron Grip\\nWhen he had survived from the flood of surprise that \\ndrowned him, the court poet Nallavan Sattanar said, \"My \\nLord! Does it mean ...? The poet who wrote these verses \\nis...\"\\n\"It is this Emperor of the earth who lies on this sick -bed \\nwithout the use of his legs,\" spoke the Emperor.\\nSeveral exclamations of surprise rose among the poets as \\nthey talked and whispered quietly amongst themselves. \\nThey moved their hands and heads in an agitated manner, \\nnot knowing how to express their thoughts; others sat 8perfectly still immobilized by the declaration they had \\nheard!\\nSundara Chozla continued to speak. \"Dear poe ts! Long ago \\nsome poets and bards came to see me in Pazlayarai. Some \\nof you may have been in that group. Each of them sang \\nverses in praise of the benevolence of my clan, my \\nforefathers. Some of them sang a few lines about me also. \\nThey praised me saying, `I gave this to that one and that to \\nthis person.\\' My young daughter Kundavai, the Younger \\nPirati was also seated beside me. Soon the poets left after \\nreceiving gifts and awards. Kundavai kept singing their \\npraises commenting on the excellence of their poe try. I \\nchallenged Kundavai, saying that I could compose much \\nbetter verse, more imaginative and extravagant than any of \\nthose poets. And I composed those lines playfully at that \\ntime and asked Kundavai for a reward. My darling child \\nclung to my back and pi nched my cheeks saying `Here is \\nyour reward.\\' I can remember that incident as if it was \\nyesterday. But it must be more than eight or nine years \\nnow.\"\\n\"Great! Remarkable! Surprising! Astounding!\" rose \\nseveral voices from the group.\\nAs soon as he heard the  name Kundavai, Vandiya Devan\\'s \\nwhole body became attentive. He had heard much about \\nthat Princess of the Chozla clan: about her beauty, her \\nintelligence, her ability and learning. Here is the fortunate \\nfather who gave birth to that astonishing Princess an d her \\nmother is seated close by. The Emperor speaks of his \\ndaughter with such pride! His voice quivers when he \\nmentions her name...\\nVandiya Devan\\'s right hand searched in his pouch hidden \\nin his waistband. The palm leaf roll of letters that he was \\ncarrying for Kundavai, were in that pouch. His searching \\npalm halted in startled alarm. He was appalled.\\nDear me! What is this? I cannot find the letter! Where is \\nthe letter? Where could it have fallen? Could it have fallen \\naccidentally when I took out the lette r meant for the \\nEmperor? Where would it have fallen? In the audience \\nchamber ... Perhaps it will fall in the hands of the \\nCommander! Is there any danger if that happens? Oh! \\nWhat a blunder! What a great mistake! What shall I do ...\\nHe could not remain in that place patiently after he \\nrealized that he had lost the letter meant for Kundavai. He \\ndid not hear any of the conversation in that room. \\nWhatever he heard his mind did not comprehend.\\nSundara Chozla was still talking to that astonished group \\nof poets. \"Kundavai must have repeated the verse I \\ncomposed in playfulness to some one. Perhaps she recited \\nit to her teacher, the Priest Esanya Bhattar of Pazlayarai. \\nHe has spread it all over the nation and made me the object \\nof mockery!\"\"My Lord! So what if th e poem was written by you? It is a \\nwonderful poem. There is no doubt about that! Besides \\nbeing the Emperor of the Nation, you are also an Emperor \\namong Poets!\" said the court poet.\\n\"However, if I had sung this poem now, I would have \\nadded one more line. I would not have stopped with giving \\nan elephant to Indra, horses to Surya and a palanquin to the \\nGreat Shiva. Remember Lord Shiva kicked the Lord of \\nDeath to protect his favorite devotee Markandeya? When \\nhe was kicked, that fearsome Lord of Death escaped w ith a \\nfew wounds. But Death\\'s vehicle, the water -buffalo fell \\ndown dead right there. The Lord of Death suffered without \\na proper vehicle to execute his duties... Sundara Chozla of \\nPazlayarai saw his problem and presented Yama, the Lord \\nof Death, with a huge water-buffalo! Yama now rides upon \\nthat beast comfortably and is fast approaching me.  Even \\nmy able Commander of Tanjore cannot stop Yama riding \\non his buffalo from coming to me.\"\\nWhen she heard these words, Vanama Devi seated next to \\nhim, looked at her lord with tears streaming down her face. \\nEven the poets were moved, filled with a tremendous \\nsadness. Only the Younger Lord Pazluvoor seemed \\nunshaken. \"My Sire! In your service, I shall be ready to \\nwage war even with death!\" he declared.\\n\"I have no doubt about that, Commander! But no human \\nbeing has the power to fight death. We merely have the \\npower to pray and ask the God\\'s to give us the ability to \\nnot fear death. Perhaps one of you remember those verses \\nof one of our Tamil saints who sang, `We shall no t fear \\ndeath.\\' Does anyone know that poem?\" asked the Emperor.\\nA poet rose up to repeat that verse:\\nWe are bondsmen to none; nor do we fear the Lord of Death;We shall not suffer the horrors of hell;Neither are we at all times incapable To overcome the misfortunes of ill health.\\nThe Emperor intervened at this line to say \"Ah! Who but a \\ngreat soul who has seen the vision of the Lord could sing \\nthis daring verse so fearlessly? Saint Appar had suffered \\nwith fearful consumption. But he overcame that ill he alth \\nwith the grace of God. That is why he sang the line about \\n`Overcoming the misfortunes of ill health.\\' My dear poets! \\nPlease stop composing verse in praise of me or my clan. \\nSing such poems about divine grace from now onwards. \\nAppar, Sambanda and Sunda ra Murti have sung thousands \\nof such exquisite devotional poems in sweet Tamil. How \\nwonderful it would be if we could collect all those verses \\nin one anthology? One lifetime will not be adequate to \\nread and enjoy all of it!\" \\n\"King of Kings, with your per mission we are ready to \\nbegin that task right away!\"9\"No; it is not a task that can be completed in my lifetime. \\nAfter me ... \" the Emperor hesitated and became immersed \\nin his own thoughts.\\nThe palace physician came close to the Younger Lord \\nPazluvoor and whispered something in his ears. Sundara \\nChozla seemed to recover from his contemplation as if \\nstartled from a nightmare. He looked around, his eyes \\nsearching for something. He seemed to be a man returning \\nfrom a different world; as if he had glimpsed a t the world \\nof the Lord of death.\\nLord Pazluvoor, the Commander, asked, \"My Lord! You \\nhad expressed a wish to hear some verses composed during \\nthe Sangam Age. Can these poets leave after they recite \\none such poem?\"\\n\"Yes, yes. I had forgotten. Not only my  body, even my \\nmind seems to be deteriorating. Let me hear the poem.\"\\nThe Commander made a sign to the chief poet Nallavan \\nSattanar. Upon that sign, the poet stood up and began \\nspeaking the following words:\\n\"My Lord! One of the most famous kings of your clan was \\nKarikala Valava  of the Sangam Age. He was the brave \\nwarrior who placed his tiger -flag on the Himalaya \\nMountains. During his reign, the capital of the Chozla \\nKingdom was Poompuhar or Kaviri -poom-pattinam. It was \\nthe port where goods and produce fr om various foreign \\nnations came in ships. One of the poets of that period \\ncomposed several verses in praise of that town describing \\nits wealth and prosperity. Here are a few lines describing \\nthe various goods that came into the port of that famous \\ntown:\\nHorses of noble gait came by the sea;Bagsful of black pepper brought in carts;Gemstone and gold from the northern mountains;Fragrant sandal and myrrh, forest produce of the Kudagu hills;Pearls from the southern seas, corals of the western ocean;Wealth of the Ganga and yield of the Cauvery;Food from Lanka and manufactured goods of Malaya...\\nSundara Chozla made a sign and stopped the poet when he \\ncame to this line. The poet stopped; silent.\\nThe Emperor looked at his commander and said with some \\nharshness, \"Commander, the poem speaks of the times of \\nKarikala when food came to us from Lanka. You brought \\nthese poets here to tell me this. Is it not so?\"\\n\"Yes, My Lord!\" the words of the Commander came \\nfaintly.\\n\"I understand. Please send these poets away; g ive them \\nappropriate gifts,\" said the monarch turning his face away.\\n\"Poets! Sirs! You can all take your leave now.\" The \\nCommander announced firmly. The whole group rose and departed through the door. But, they did not forget to raise \\ncheers and blessings for the Emperor as they left.\\nVandiya Devan who was quite agitated at not finding the \\nletter he had brought for Kundavai, tried to mingle with \\nthat group and escape. But, his intention did not succeed. \\nNear the doorway a vise like grip took hold of his l eft \\nhand. Vandiya Devan was quite strong. But that iron grip \\nshook him from head to toe and made him stand still. He \\nlooked up and his eyes confirmed that the iron grip \\nbelonged to the Commander, the Younger Lord Pazluvoor.\\nBy now, the poets had left the inner bed chamber.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n', 29: ' \"Our Guest\"\\nAfter the poets had departed, the palace doctor mixed a \\nmedicinal potion and brought it to the Emperor. \\nMalayaman\\'s daughter, the Queen Consort received the \\ngoblet in her hands and gave it to her lord the Emperor.\\nThe Younger Lord Pazluvoor, who waited patiently till the \\nEmperor had finished, did not let go of his vise like grip on \\nVandiya Devan\\'s hand. The Commander dragged him \\ncloser to the Emperor\\'s bed. \"My Lord! Do you see any \\nimprovement after this new medicine?\" he asked.\\n\"The doctor says that there is some benefit and Devi also \\nbelieves it. But somehow, I do not feel any hope. \\nCommander, I feel that all this is wasted effort! My fate \\nbeckons me. Yama, the Lord of Death must have gone to \\nPazlayarai in search of me.

If I too am fortunate like the forefathers of \\nmy clan, to go into the forefront of a battlefield and give \\nup my life, I shall not fear such death. Nor will I despair. I \\nshall welcome death with  enthusiasm. My elder uncle \\nRaja-aditya fought in the battle field at Takkolam from \\natop an elephant and lost his life while fighting. He \\nestablished the fame of Chozla bravery for ever in that \\nbattle of Takkolam. He became famous as the `Lord who \\nreposed atop an elephant.\\' What fame will I acquire? Will I \\ncome to be known as `Sundara Chozla who reposed atop \\nhis sickbed\\'? My other elder uncle, Gandara Aditya was \\ninvolved in his devotions and had overcome the fear of \\ndeath. He travelled to the nations on the  western ocean on \\npilgrimage and died on the seashore. He is known as `The \\nLord who reposed in the west.\\' I am not devout like him; \\nnor am I capable of embarking on a pilgrimage like him. \\nHow long can I lie upon my bed like this?

If I own \\nup to having warned about danger, suspicions about me \\nwill rise and I will surely be in danger. I must escape from \\nthis plight. Good, let me try one tactic.  Let me secure the \\nhelp of grammar and prosody to turn a mountain into a \\nmolehill!\\n\"My Majesty! Who am I to warn about danger! What \\ndanger can approach you when you have the brave \\nCommander, Lord Pazluvoor, the palace doctor and the \\nEmpress who looks like the Divine Savitri (mythical queen \\nwho saved her husband from the  Lord of Death) next to \\nyou? I petitioned to you as a stranger -- a stranger! I, an \\nignorant, lone youth, I alone am left to represent the \\nancient clan of Vaanars.

I am a \\nstranger! This stranger seeks the protection of you the \\nKing of Kings!\"  Vallavarayan spoke quickly without any \\nhesitation.\\nThe Commander who heard his  words, frowned. Sundara \\nChozla\\'s face brightened once again. Kindness filled the \\nface of the Empress.\\n\"As soon as he was born, Saraswati, the Goddess of \\nLearning, must have written on this boy\\'s tongue. His \\ncommand over words is quite remarkable!\" said t he \\nEmpress. \\nMaking use of the opportunity, Vandiya Devan turned \\ntowards her and said, \"Thaye! I Beg your grace to put in a \\nword on my behalf! I am an orphan without mother or \\nfather. I have no other patron or sponsor. I myself have to \\npetition on my behalf. Just like the Goddesses Lakshmi \\nand Parvathi speak to their Lords Vishnu and Shiva on \\nbehalf of devotees, I beseech you to speak on my cause. I \\nbeg to be given back at least ten villages of my ancient \\nkingdom. I shall be very satisfied with that.\"\\nSundara Chozla was filled with surprise and happiness as \\nhe heard these words. The Emperor called his Commander \\nand said, \"Commander, I am becoming very fond of this \\nyouth! Look at Devi\\'s face: she seems ready to adopt him \\nas her third son! Why not fulfil his  petition? There should \\nbe no problem about that? What is your opinion?\"\"What place does my opinion have in this matter!

It is routine to suspect him since he is a messenger \\nfrom Aditya Karikala. But there is no room for suspicion \\nsince my brother has sent him with the signet ring. Ah! No \\none has to advice the Elder about caution in such matters.\\nHowsoever, the sight of the youth hes itating with a fear-\\nfilled expression, as he entered the bed chamber came \\nbefore the Commander\\'s eyes.

He would be useful in times of need. Perhaps I can \\nprocure part of his ancient lands for him. Such young men \\nwill remain beholden and loyal to me if I help them once. \\nAh! But if it proven that he is an enemy, I must make \\nappropriate arrangements. Anyway, for all things, let the \\nElder return. Let us see.Upon reaching the large audience chamber, Vandiya \\nDevan began looking about here and there anxiously. He \\npeered again and again at the spot where he had taken out \\nthe letter to give it to the Commander. \\nPerhaps by accident the other letter, the important letter \\nhas fallen there. If I cannot retrieve that letter there is no \\ngreater fool than me! I shall never be able to meet the \\nworld renowned Princess Kundavai. I shall not be a ble to \\ncomplete half the task assigned to me by Prince Aditya \\nKarikala.\\nThe Younger Lord Pazluvoor looked at one of his servants \\nand said, \"Lead this young man to our palace. Take him to \\nour guest house and make all arrangements for his comfort \\n-- look after him. Wait there till I come.\"\\nVandiya Devan and the servant left. Another servant \\napproached him and respectfully extended his hand with a \\npalm leaf roll in it. \"This was lying in the corridor on the \\nway to the Emperor\\'s bed -chamber. It might have fal len \\nfrom the waist-belt of the youth who left just now.\"\\nThe Commander accepted it eagerly and examined it. His \\neyebrows shot half way up his forehead in a frown! A \\ndreadful expression came upon his face.\\n\"Ah ha! A letter written to the Younger Pirati by  Aditya \\nKarikala. In the Prince\\'s own handwriting: -- `... .. you had \\nasked for a retainer --  a capable, courageous youth for use \\nin confidential matters; I am sending him to you for that \\npurpose. You can trust him completely regarding all affairs \\nand entrust any task to him. He will personally give you \\nmy message and details of the situation here...\\' -- Ah! \\nThere is some mystery in this! I wonder if the Elder Lord \\nknows about this letter. I must be more careful in handling \\nthis youngster!\" The Commander o f Tanjore muttered \\nthese words to himself as he read some parts of the letter. \\nHe beckoned to the servant who had picked up the letter \\nand whispered some words in his ear. That man \\nimmediately left the audience chamber.\\nAll courtesies and comforts were sh own to Vandiya Devan \\nin the palace of the Younger Lord Pazluvoor. They led him \\nto a luxurious bath and helped him wear new clothes. \\nVandiya Devan who was fond of wearing new fashionable \\nclothes, dressed himself in the fresh garments with \\nenthusiasm. He almost forgot his worry about the lost \\nletter. After he had dressed in the new raiment, they served \\nhim courteously and elegantly with a tasty meal of many \\ncourses. Being hungry, Vandiya Devan did justice to the \\nmeal. Later they led him to the art gallery in that palace. \\n\"Till the Commander returns you can enjoy the beautiful \\npictures and art-works in this gallery,\" said the servant. \\nAfter saying this, three men -- guards -- sat down outside \\nthat chamber, near the doorway and began a game of dice.\\nIn those days, Tanjore, the new capital of the Chozla\\'s, was \\nfamous for its art and painting. Just as music and dance 2were nurtured in Thiru -vai-aru, painting and sculpture \\nwere encouraged in Tanjore.\\nThe art gallery attached to the palace of the Younger Lord \\nPazluvoor was famous. Vandiya Devan entered that art \\ngallery now. He looked again and again at the several large \\npictures painted on the walls of that chamber and was \\nenthralled. He forgot himself in that happiness; he forgot \\nthe task for which he had come.\\nThe portrait gallery on one side, depicting the pictures of \\nancient rulers of the Chozla clan and important events in \\ntheir history attracted his attention. A large part of that \\ngallery was given to depict the history over the last \\nhundred years of the Choz la nation. Those were the \\npictures that aroused the greatest interest in Vandiya \\nDevan.\\nAt this point, the author wishes to briefly remind our \\nreaders of the history and genealogy of the Chozlas who \\nruled for hundred years before the times of this story, from \\nPazlayarai and Tanjore. It would be very useful to know \\nthese details to understand further incidents in this tale.\\nWe have mentioned earlier about Vijayala Chozla who \\nbore ninety-six scars of battle wounds like ornaments on \\nhis body. Chozla kings cu stomarily bore the titles \\nParakesari and Rajakesari one succeeding the other. After \\nParakesari Vijayala, his son Rajakesari Aditya Chozla \\ncame to the throne. He was a deserving son to his father. In \\nthe beginning he fought on the side of the Pallava \\nmonarchs to defeat their common enemy, the Pandiyas and \\nestablish the Chozla entity. Later he engaged in battle \\nagainst his former ally the Pallava King Aparajita. Pallava \\nAparajita entered the battlefield seated on a howdah atop \\nan elephant. Aditya jumped onto that war elephant and \\nfought his enemy, killing him and thus captured all of \\nThondai for the Chozlas. Later the Kongu Kingdom came \\nunder Aditya\\'s rule. Rajakesari Aditya I, was an ardent \\ndevotee of Shiva. He constructed several Shiva temples \\nalong the banks of the holy Cauvery -- from the Sahasya \\nhills where the river rose till it entered the seas in the east.\\nAfter Rajakesari Aditya, Parakesari Paranthaka ascended \\nthe Chozla throne. He ruled for forty -six years. Next to \\nKarikala of the ancient times who h ad established his tiger -\\nflag over the Himalayas, this Paranthaka was the greatest \\nof Chozla kings. He had several honors and titles like \\n\"Veera-narayana\", \"Lover of Poets\", \"Best among \\nWrestlers\", \"Jewel among the Braves\", etc. He was also \\nknown as the `Chozla who took (conquered) Madurai and \\nLanka\\'. Even during the times of this Paranthaka I, the \\nChozla nation spread from the shores of Cape Comorin to \\nthe banks of the Krishna -Tungabadra rivers in the north. \\nFor some time the tiger -flag flew over Lanka als o. He was \\nthe same Paranthaka who became famous for having \\ncovered the roof of the temple at Chidambaram with gold. \\nTowards the end of his reign several dangers seized the \\nChozla Empire. In those days, the Rashtrakutas who were \\nvery powerful in the north t ried to contain the growing powers of the Chozlas. They led an army against the \\nChozlas and were successful to some extent.\\nParanthaka had at least three sons. The eldest among these \\nsons was Raja-aditya. Expecting an invasion from the \\nnorth, this Raja-aditya waited with a very large army for \\nseveral years in Thiru-munai-padi. He constructed the \\nlarge Veera Narayana Lake in the name of his father.\\nA terrible war was fought between the Chozla forces and \\nthe Rashtrakuta armies at a place known as Takkolam n ear \\npresent day Arakonam. In that battle, Raja -aditya fought \\nvaliantly and showered havoc upon the enemy forces. But, \\nhe lost his life in the battlefield and went to the heavens \\nmeant for braves. He too fought from the howdah of an \\nelephant like the Pallav a Aparajita. Since he died while \\nriding the battle elephant he was referred to as the `Lord \\nwho reposed atop an elephant\\' in latter day stone -\\ninscriptions.\\nIf Raja-aditya had not died in the battlefield, he would \\nhave ruled the Chozla nation after his fat her Paranthaka I. \\nHis descendants would, in the normal course, have \\nascended the throne after him. But since he died before \\nascending the throne and without any offspring, his brother \\nGandara Aditya was crowned as king with the title of \\nRajakesari according to the wishes of their father.\\nLike his father and grand -father, Gandara Aditya was a \\ndevotee and follower of Shiva. In addition, he was fond of \\nTamil literature. In fact, he did not have much interest in \\nruling his nation for he was more involved in wo rship at \\ntemples and in enjoyment of poetry. Following the \\ntradition of the Saiva Nayanmar saints, he composed \\nseveral devotional poems on God Shiva. In an anthology \\nof these poems known as Thiru -isai-pa he refers to himself \\ntowards the end:\\nLike his noble Sire who covered The roof of the dancer at Chidambaram with red gold,May Gandara Aditya, monarch of flourishing Kozli,Lord of the people of Tanjore, expert in exquisite Tamil verse,May he attain everlasting greatness and happiness.\\nThough the kings after Vijayala Chozla ruled from \\nPazlayarai and Tanjore, they did not forget their rights to \\ntheir ancient capital Uraiyoor, which was also called Kozli \\n(rooster). Chozla monarchs styled themselves as `Rooster \\nKings.\\'\\nThough Gandara Aditya sat on the Choz la throne and ruled \\nin name, his younger brother Arinjaya took care of the \\ngoverning of the nation. Arinjaya had been stationed in the \\nnorthern provinces helping his eldest brother Raja -aditya. \\nHe fought bravely in the battles against the Rashtrakutas. \\nHe was the instrument for turning the terrible defeat of the \\nChozla armies at Takkolam into a victory by stopping the \\ninvading forces at the northern banks of River Pennar.\\nTherefore, Rajakesari Gandara Aditya chose his younger \\nbrother Arinjaya as the Crown Prince and designated him 3as his successor to the throne. There was another important \\nreason for this decision of Gandara Aditya. His first wife \\nhad died several years before he came to inherit the throne. \\nAfter her death, Gandara Aditya had not married ag ain for \\nseveral years. However, his younger brother Arinjaya \\nalready had a handsome, capable and intelligent son. \\nThat son named after his grandfather Paranthaka, was \\nknown as Sundara -- the name bestowed on him by the \\npeople. Gandara Aditya willed that after him his brother \\nArinjaya, and after Arinjaya, Sundara should succeed to \\nthe Chozla throne. He obtained the approval of all the \\nleaders of the land, the chieftains, the commanders, the \\nchiefs of the cities and guilds, and announced his \\nintentions publicly.\\nAfter all such arrangements were made, a surprising \\nincident occurred in his life. He happened to meet the \\nyoung daughter, of a petty chieftain named Mazlava -raya. \\nThe beauty, modesty, virtue and piety of that jewel among \\nmaids, Sembiyan Madevi, att racted him. In his advanced \\nage he married that young maid. As a result of this \\nmarriage a child was born in due course. They named the \\nchild Madurandaka and cherished him. But, both the King \\nas well as the Queen did not wish to change any of the \\narrangements they had made earlier about the kingdom. \\nThe couple were both involved in piety, devotion and \\nrenouncement of the world; they wished to raise their son \\nin a similar ascetic fashion. Once again the King \\nproclaimed his wish that after him, his brother Ar injaya and Arinjaya\\'s descendants should have the right to ascend \\nthe Chozla throne.\\nThus, bypassing the two lines of the elder brothers Raja -\\naditya and Gandara Aditya, the line of Arinjaya Chozla \\nbecame heirs to the Chozla throne.\\nParakesari Arinjaya wh o ruled after Gandara Aditya, did \\nnot live for a long time. Within one year he followed his \\nelder brothers to the heavenly abodes.\\nAfter him, the citizens, chieftains, leaders and guildsmen \\nhappily crowned Prince Sundara as their king. Rajakesari \\nParanthaka Sundara Chozla was an able ruler of the \\nkingdom that came to him by good fortune. In the early \\nyears of his reign he performed various deeds of valor and \\nonce again acquired the lost Pandiya and Thondai \\nTerritories. He drove away the Rashtrakuta armies from \\nthe banks of the Pennar.\\nAditya Karikala and Arulmozli Varma, the two sons of \\nEmperor Sundara Chozla, were able warriors and worthy \\nsons of their father. Both sons cooperated and helped their \\nfather with complete devotion. These sons had experienced \\nbattlefield and war at very young ages. In every campaign \\nthey participated, the Goddess of Victory  stood on the side \\nof the Chozlas.\\n*****\\nPrincipal Characters in Ponniyin Selvan\\nAditya Karikala -Crown Prince of the Chozla Empire, Sundara Chozla\\'s eld est son.\\nAmudan\\'s Mother -A deaf-mute, garden keeper on the outskirts of Tanjore.\\nAnirudda Brahma-raya -The Prime Minister and confidant of Sundara Chozla.\\nArinjaya Chozla-Sundara Chozla\\'s father, King Gandara Aditya\\'s younger brother, died after ruling fo r \\nmerely one year.\\nArulmozli Varma -Sundara Chozla\\'s younger son.\\nAstrologer of Kudanthai - An astrologer patronized by Kundavai, a spy of sorts.\\nAzlvar-adiyan Nambi, Thirumalai Appan - A follower of the Vaishnava faith, step brother of Esanya \\nBhattar, a spy. \\nEsanya Bhattar -A priest of Pazlayarai, elder brother of Azhvar -adiyan Nambi.\\nGandara Aditya -Sundara Chozla\\'s elder uncle, a devout follower of the Saiva faith, ruled before Arinjaya \\nChozla.\\nIdumban Kari -A footman from Kadamboor, a conspirator again st Chozla royalty, member of a gang \\nsympathetic to Pandiyas.\\nKalyani of Vaithumba - Widow of King Arinjaya Chozla, a famous beauty, Sundara Chozla\\'s mother.\\nKandamaran- A young man, son of Sengannan Sambuvaraya of Kadamboor.\\nKundavai, Younger Pirati - Sundara Chozla\\'s daughter.\\nLord Velir of Kodumbalur, the Elder, Bhoothi Vikrama  Kesari - An important chieftain of the Chozla \\nEmpire, Commander of Chozla Armies in Lanka.

      "Come, oh come all ye girls, To look at the Cauvery tumbling by!\n",
      "Such flood-songs pleasingly flooded the ears of Vandiya \n",
      "Devan. Others sang ballads about the bravery and fame of \n",
      "Chozla kings. Some girls sang of Vijayala Chozl a who had \n",

      "bravery of his son, Aditya Chozla, and how he constructed \n",
      "sixty-four Shiva temples all along the Cauvery - from \n",
      "where it rose till it mingled into the sea. One girl sang the \n",
      "fame of King Aditya's son, Paranthaka Chozla, who had \n",
      "not only conquered the Pandiya, Pallava and Chera kings \n",
      "but had also sent an army to Lanka to hoist his victory flag. \n",
      "When each girl sang, several people stood ar ound her \n",

      "down from your horse to eat this stewed rice,\" she said.\n",
      "Immediately several young girls noticed our youthful \n",
      "traveller. They whispered amongst themselves about his \n",
      "appearance and laughed merrily. Vandiya Devan was \n",
      "overcome by a certain mortification on one side and \n",
      "delight on the other. For a moment he considered \n",
      "dismounting and eating the food offered by the old \n",

      "around to tease and laugh. \n",
      "So what? Is it easy to behold so many beautiful maidens in \n",

      "the lake shore appeared like the heavenly nymphs Ramba \n",
      "and Menaka!At the same time he noticed something towards th e south-\n",
      "west along the flow of River Vadavaru and hesitated. \n",
      "About seven or eight large boats with white, spreading \n",
      "sails filled with the breeze were coming swiftly like white \n",
      "swans floating with wide -spread wings. \n",
      "All the people engaged in various merri ments turned to \n",
      "avidly look in the direction from which the boats were \n",
      "coming. One of the boats came forward more swiftly and \n",
      "reached the lake shore where the embankment turned west. \n",
      "Several well-built footmen carrying sharp & shiny spears \n",

      "picked up their containers and belongings and quickly \n",
      "started climbing upon the bank. Vandiya Devan could not \n",
      "understand any of this. Who were these men? Who were \n",
      "coming in the sailboats behind them? Where were they \n",
      "coming from? Perhaps they belonged to the royal \n",

      "Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan approached an elderly man \n",
      "leaning upon his cane by the bank . \"Sir, whose men are \n",
      "these? And whose boats are those coming behind like a \n",

      "One of the debaters seemed to be an exceptional follower \n",

      "hair into a topknot on his forehead. A short staff was in his \n",

      "employed both his legs to apply a sudden pressure to the \n",
      "underbelly of his horse. At the same time he drew his \n",
      "sword from its scabbard at his waist. The swirling sword \n",
      "flashing like swift lightning in his hand appeared like God \n",
      "Vishnu's spinning Chakra (discus). The horse galloped \n",
      "forward into the fortress. The men in the way seemed to \n",
      "suddenly fall down. Lances and spears wer e thrown apart, \n",
      "clanging noisily. The horse flew amidst the gossiping men \n",
      "of Pazluvoor. The totally unexpected, lightning attack \n",
      "scattered the men in all four directions.\n",
      "Several other actions took place immediately: The fortress \n",
      "gates banged shut thunder ingly. \"Catch him! Hold!\" shouts \n",
      "arose; spears rubbed against swords making a \"clang, \n",
      "clang\" noise. Suddenly the drums announcing danger, \n",
      "boomed \"dadam, dadadam\". Several men -- maybe twenty, \n",
      "thirty, fifty or even more -- surrounded Vandiya Devan \n",
      "and his horse. He jumped down to the ground; swirling his \n",
      "sword in all directions he shouted \"Kandamara! \n",
      "Kandamara! Your men are killing me!\"\n",
      "Hearing his words, the men were stunned into hesitation \n",
      "and moved away a little.\n",
      "At the same time a thundering voice was heard from the \n",
      "upper balcony of the palace tower. \"What is that noise out \n",
      "there? Stop it!\"  Several persons were standing there, \n",
      "looking down on the disturbance below.\n",
      "\"Master! Some fellow has broken our guard and entered \n",
      "here. He is shouting the young ma ster's name,\" replied the \n",
      "gate-keeper. \"Kandamara, go find out what the commotion \n",
      "is about,\" said the thundering voice from the tower. \n",
      "Vandiya Devan surmised the voice to be that of Lord \n",
      "Sambuvaraya.\n",
      "He and the men surrounding him waited for a while. \n",
      "\"What is all this about?\" a young voice said. The men \n",
      "parted to make way for a youth coming hurriedly.  He \n",
      "noticed Vandiya Devan who stood there twirling his \n",
      "sword, like God Muruga after killing the Demon Soora.\n",
      "\"Vallava! Is it truly you?\" he said in an emoti onal voice \n",
      "and ran forward to heartily embrace his friend. \n",
      "\"Kandamara because you repeatedly insisted, I came to \n",
      "your house. I received this warlike welcome here,\" \n",
      "Vallavarayan pointed to the men around him.\n",
      "Kandamaran said to his men, \"You idiots! Move a side. \n",
      "Your brains are like budding shoots on a pounding block.\" 2Kandamaran took hold of his friend's hand and led him \n",
      "hastily into the castle. His feet did not stay put on earth; \n",
      "and his heart danced with joy. What can captivate the heart \n",
      "of a youth more than a true friendship from his youthful \n",
      "days? Yes, of course there is a thing called kaadal (love). \n",
      "But being in love has as much sadness and pain as joy and \n",
      "pleasure. In the cheerful friendship of youth there is not \n",
      "even a shadow of sadness. All is hear t pleasing happiness.\n",
      "\"Kandamara, what is all this hustle and bustle about? What \n",
      "is happening here today?\" asked Vandiya Devan.\n",
      "\"Oh! I'll explain what's happening here afterwards. \n",
      "Remember the days when you and I were at the army \n",

      "times about my friend Vandiya Devan of the Vaanar Clan. \n",
      "This is he.\"  Vandiya Devan bowed and g reeted him with \n",
      "reverence. However, Lord Sambuvaraya did not seem too \n",
      "happy about it.\n",
      "\"Is that so? Is he the fellow who created all that \n",
      "disturbance at the palace gates below?\" asked the father.\n",
      "\"He was not the cause for the disturbance. It's those idiot s \n",

      "\"Still, he need not have arrived in this sensational manner; \n",

      "Kandamaran frowned. He did not wish to continue the \n",
      "debate with his father. He led Vandiya Devan aside. He \n",
      "presented his friend to Lord Pazluvoor, seated on a lofty \n",
      "throne amidst the other guests, and said \"Uncle! This is my \n",
      "dear friend Vandiya Devan. He is from the noble Vaanar \n",
      "clan.  He and I were on guard duty at the army bas e north \n",
      "of the Pennar river. In those days he would often express a \n",
      "wish to `See and meet the bravest among warriors, the \n",
      "great Lord of Pazluvoor' and would often ask `Is it really \n",
      "true that he has sixty-four war-wounds on his body?' I \n",
      "would tell him `One day you can meet him and count \n",
      "them'.\"\n",
      "\"Is that so Thambi? Will you not believe it unless you \n",
      "personally count  them? Such distrust?  You suspect that \n",
      "none but one of the Vaanar clan can be brave?\" said Lord \n",
      "Pazluvoor.\n",
      "Both friends were startled. They ha d not expected the \n",
      "nobleman to thus misconstrue their words of praise. \n",
      "Vandiya Devan felt irritated. Without showing his feelings he said \"Sir! The fame of the brave Pazluvoor clan has \n",

      "doubt it?\" \n",
      "\"Good reply. Intelligent fellow\" muttered Lord Pazluvoor.\n",
      "With a feeling of having escaped with that, the friends \n",
      "went out. Lord Sambuvaraya called out to his son and \n",

      "based upon Kandamaran's descriptions of his younger \n",

      "\"My mother is calling me. Wait right here. I'll be back \n",
      "instantly,\" said Kandamaran as he went inside once again. \n",
      "The voices of several women talking all at once, the sound \n",
      "of questions being asked one upon the other and \n",
      "Kandamaran answering them with some  confusion could \n",
      "be heard. He also heard the women inside laughing gaily. \n",
      "The thought that they were perhaps laughing at him caused \n",
      "some shame and anger in Vandiya Devan. When \n",
      "Kandamaran came out, he took hold of his friend's hand \n",
      "and dragged him onwards s aying, \"Come let us look \n",

      "chambers, living quarters, audience halls, turrets, towers, \n",
      "stables and other places. After a while Van diya Devan \n",
      "asked, \"Kandamara, you made me wait outside your \n",
      "mother's chambers and went in again. At that time what \n",
      "was so special to provoke the laughter and joy inside? \n",
      "Were the women so happy to see me, your friend?\"\n",
      "\"They were all very happy to meet yo u. In fact my mother \n",

      "these years he has recently married a very young girl. He \n",
      "has brought her here in a covered palanquin. Apparently he \n",
      "has kept her locked up in his own chambers without \n",
      "sending her to the inner apartments in the palace. One of \n",
      "the maids who saw the girl by peeping in through the \n",
      "window, came and described her beauty. That is the cause \n",
      "for the laughter.  They were discussing if she was a \n",
      "Singhala girl, a Kalinga lady or perhaps a maid from \n",
      "Chera. You know that the ancestors of the Pazluvoor clan \n",
      "originally came here from the Chera country?\"\n",
      "\"I have heard it too. Perhaps you had told me ea rlier. \n",
      "That's OK! Kandamara, how long is it since Lord \n",
      "Pazluvoor married this mysterious beauty?\"\n",
      "\"It must be less than two years. He has not left her alone \n",
      "for even a short while from the time he married her! He \n",
      "takes his ladylove along wherever he goes;  in a closed \n",
      "palanquin! In fact there has been a lot of sniggering about \n",
      "it all over the country. Vandiya Deva, won't there be \n",
      "ridicule and derision if men who are past a certain age get \n",
      "involved in such entanglements with women?\"\n",
      "\"I do not think that is the reason. Kandamara, shall I tell \n",
      "you the real reason for the laughter? Generally women are \n",
      "envious. Don't think I am belittling the women in your \n",
      "family. All womankind is like that! The women of your \n",
      "household are dark-colored beauties. However, Lord \n",
      "Pazluvoor's beloved is rosily -fair and golden hued. That is \n",
      "why these women do not like her; they are making up \n",
      "stories about her...!\"\n",
      "\"Hey! What is this wonder? How do you know about her \n",
      "complexion? Why, have you seen her? Where? How did \n",
      "you see her? If Lord Pazluvoor knows of this, your life is \n",
      "not yours!\"\n",
      "\"Kandamara, I am not afraid of all that. You know it. \n",
      "Moreover, I have not done anything improper. I was \n",
      "watching, one among the crowd on the roadside, when \n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor and his retinue went past. The  elephant, \n",
      "horses, livery, footmen, drummers -- I believe all these \n",
      "were honors sent by your family to receive him. Is that \n",
      "true?\"\n",
      "\"Yes we had sent all those accolades. So what ...?\"\n",
      "\"So what? Nothing. I was just comparing the reception that \n",
      "you accorded to Lord Pazluvoor and the welcome given to \n",
      "me; nothing else ...\"\n",
      "Kandamaran laughed lightly, \"We gave him the tribute and \n",
      "honor due to the official who levies taxes. A welcome \n",
      "appropriate to a great warrior was given to you! Sometime, \n",
      "with God Muruga's grace, when you become the son -in-\n",
      "law to our house we shall give you the honors due to a \n",
      "bridegroom and welcome you.\" He then added, \"But, you were about to say something \n",
      "else; we were sidetracked. Oh yes! You were saying that \n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor's beloved was  very fair and light in color. \n",
      "How did you know that?\"\n",
      "\"Lord Pazluvoor was coming seated on the dark, huge \n",
      "elephant from Kadamboor Fort: like Yama, the God of \n",
      "Justice seated upon a huge water -buffalo! All my thoughts \n",
      "were concentrated on him. While I was building dream-\n",
      "empires about one day becoming famous and powerful like \n",
      "him, a covered palanquin followed him. Even as I \n",
      "wondered about who could come in a covered palanquin, a \n",
      "hand from inside parted the curtains. I could barely see the \n",
      "face within. The hand and face were golden -hued. That \n",
      "was all I saw. From what you said just now, I realize that \n",
      "she must be the beloved of Lord Pazluvoor.\"\n",
      "\"Vandiya Deva, you are a lucky fellow! It is being said \n",
      "that no man has glimpsed upon that Young -Queen of \n",
      "Pazluvoor. You could at least see her hand and face for a \n",
      "second. From what you saw, can you guess anything about \n",
      "the nation which gave birth to that beauty?\" asked \n",
      "Kandamaran.\n",
      "\"I did not ponder about it at that time. Now that I think of \n",
      "it, she is perhaps a woman f rom the Kashmir country; or \n",
      "she is a beauty who hails from the distant lands across the \n",
      "sea like Java, Kadaram (Malaya), Yavana (Greece -Rome). \n",
      "Maybe she is a princess from Arabia: I believe that women \n",
      "in that country are hidden behind veils from birth till\n",
      "death.\"\n",
      "At that moment, the sound of musical instruments could be \n",
      "heard somewhere nearby. Several kinds of drums, flutes, \n",
      "pipes and instruments like salli, karadi, parai, udukku  \n",
      "were being tuned together. \"What is that noise?\" asked \n",
      "Vallavarayan.\n",
      "\"The Kuravai Koothu (gypsy dance) is about to begin. The \n",
      "drums and flutes are being tuned in preparation. Would \n",
      "you like to watch the gypsy dance? Or, would you like to \n",
      "eat early and sleep well?\" \n",
      "Vandiya Devan recalled Azlvar -adiyan mentioning the \n",
      "gypsy dance. \"I have never seen the gypsy dance; I must \n",
      "surely see it,\" he said.\n",
      "When they walked ahead a little and turned, they could see \n",
      "the stage being set for the dancers. The guests were \n",
      "gathering in front of the stage. The stage for the gypsy \n",
      "dance was set in a wide courtyard spread with clean -white \n",
      "sand and situated in a spot surrounded by the palace walls \n",
      "and the towering battlements of the fort. The stage was \n",
      "decorated with colorful drawings of cocks, peacocks, \n",
      "swans and parrots. They had further decked the  stage with \n",
      "several fragrant flower garlands, red -rice popped white, \n",
      "colored millet, yellow turmeric and other powders, \n",
      "kunrimani (small red berry -beads), and other vivid \n",
      "decorations.  Tall oil-lamps and flaming torches tried to \n",
      "drive the darkness away. Bu t the swirling fragrance from 4smoldering frankincense and smokey torches created a \n",
      "misty screen dimming the lights.  The musicians sat on \n",
      "both sides and in front of the stage and played their \n",
      "instruments with gusto. The fragrant flowers, sweet \n",
      "smelling incense and the drum beats all together made \n",
      "Vandiya Devan feel light -headed.\n",
      "After all the important guests were seated, the nine \n",
      "maidens who were to perform the gypsy dance came on \n",
      "the stage. They wore the tight fitting clothes and \n",
      "ornaments suitable for d ancing; they had bell-filled anklets \n",
      "on their feet; brilliant red hued flowers of the hill country, \n",
      "flowers favored by the God Muruga, decorated their \n",
      "hairstyles. A long garland woven with such flowers thrown \n",
      "upon their shoulders, seemed to bind them to ea ch other as \n",
      "they stood upon the stage. In their hands they daintily \n",
      "grasped beautiful parrots made of sandalwood painted a \n",
      "vivid green.\n",
      "After greeting the audience they began to sing and dance. \n",
      "They first sang a few verses in praise of God Muruga. \n",
      "They sang of the brave deeds of Muruga; and they sang of \n",
      "his victorious spear which killed the demons Soora -padma \n",
      "and Gaja-mukha and then dried up the vast ocean. They \n",
      "sang of how he chose for his bride, a maid from the Tamil \n",
      "country, a gypsy maid from the hills who was guarding the \n",
      "millet fields, even as heavenly nymphs offered prayers to \n",
      "marry the young warrior -God. Their song celebrated the \n",
      "grace and benevolence of Velan, i.e., Murugan who bears \n",
      "the spear. The lyrical songs, the fast paced dance, the quick \n",
      "drum-beats, enchanting flute all in combination bewitched \n",
      "those who were watching. With the following words of \n",
      "prayer the dance concluded:\n",
      "Let hunger and disease be destroyed;Let enmity be routed;Let rain and fertility increase;Let bounty grow boundless.\n",
      "The maidens stepped off the stage and moved away.\n",
      "Next, a man and woman dressed as oracles -- thevar-aalan \n",
      "and thevar-aati,  came on stage. The divine -man and \n",
      "divine-woman wore blood-red clothes. They had brilliant \n",
      "garlands made of blood -red oleander flowers. They had \n",
      "painted their foreheads with bright red kumkum powders. \n",
      "Even their lips seemed blood -red because they had chewed \n",
      "the betel leaf and areca -nut. Their eyes seemed blood -shot! \n",
      "The Velan Attam or oracle dance, began calmly enough. \n",
      "They danced by themselves and with arms linked together. \n",
      "As time passed the tempo and passion increased. The \n",
      "divine-woman picked up a spear from the side. The man \n",
      "tried to pry it from her hands; and she would not let go. \n",
      "The dance became more frenzied: finally the man leaped \n",
      "across the resonating stage, jumping high, he plucked the \n",
      "spear from his companion. With an expression of fear on \n",
      "her face she moved away behind the screens.\n",
      "The divine-man now danced all by himself with more and \n",
      "more rapid movements. He acted the part of the God Velan killing the demon Soora. Soora's head was chopped off \n",
      "repeatedly. But the severed -head grew back again and \n",
      "again. Velan grew angrier and angrier as the head came \n",
      "back again and again. Sparks flew from his eyes. In the \n",
      "end Soora fell dead. Thevar-aalan threw his spear down.\n",
      "By now all musical instruments were quiet. Only the little \n",
      "hand-held drum, the udukku could be heard. A priest stood \n",
      "near the stage fanatically beating the hand -drum. Each part \n",
      "of Thevar-aalan's body shuddered. Thos e in the audience \n",
      "whispered to each other: \"The spirit has materialized.\" \n",
      "Soon the priest looked at the frenzied Thevar -aalan and \n",
      "said, \"Vela! Muruga! Commander of the Gods! Lord who \n",

      "your devotees.\"\n",
      "\"Ask fellow! Ask whatever you want! I will reveal all!\" \n",
      "replied the delirious man. \"Will the rains be good? Shall \n",

      "\"The rains will be in season. The  waters would be \n",
      "abundant. The land will be fruitful and desires will be \n",
      "fulfilled! But you have not made offerings to my Mother! \n",
      "The Goddess desires a sacrifice. The Mother -Goddess \n",
      "wants a sacrifice!\" shouted the dancer in delirium.\n",
      "\"What sacrifice?\" asked the priest.\n",
      "\"Will it be offered if I ask?\"\n",
      "\"Yes, we will offer it. We shall surely offer the sacrifice.\"\n",
      "\"She wants the blood of royalty! She thirsts for the blood \n",
      "of a prince from a thousand year -old dynasty!\" shouted the \n",

      "Pazluvoor, Lord of Mazluvoor, Lord Sambuvaraya and \n",

      "sign to the priest.\n",
      "The priest stopped beating his hand -drum. The dancer \n",
      "dropped upon the stage like a felled tree. The woman \n",

      "silently. Somewhere outside, the howling of wolves could \n",
      "be heard.\n",
      "Vandiya Devan, who had been watch ing all this with some \n",
      "agitation, looked towards the direction in which the \n",
      "howling wolves were heard. There, atop the outer ramparts \n",
      "of the fortress, he saw a head! \n",
      "It was Azlvar-adiyan's head. For a second he was subject \n",
      "to a horrifying feeling. It app eared as if the severed head of \n",
      "Azlvar-adiyan had been placed upon those walls. He \n",
      "blinked his eyelids to look again: the head was no longer \n",
      "there! He felt ashamed about the worthless fear that had 5taken hold of him. Several other emotions beyond his \n",

      "Kolli Hills-- all these men were there at the banquet. \n",
      "Kandamaran whispered their names into Vandiya Devan's \n",
      "ears and pointed them out discretely.\n",
      "These dignitaries were not ordinary men; nor was it \n",
      "common to see them all assembled together in one place \n",
      "like this. Each of them was a territorial chieftain; or they \n",
      "had earned the distinction of territorial chieftains because \n",
      "of their bravery. In those days, the title araya or raya which \n",
      "was derived from the sanskrit word raja or Tamil word \n",
      "arasa (meaning king) denoted  nobility or royalty. \n",
      "Territorial chieftains and noblemen of equal rank were \n",
      "entitled to add the suffix rayan or arayan to their names. \n",
      "They were also called by the name of their town with the \n",
      "added title. (In fact our hero Vandiya Devan bore the name \n",
      "Vallava-rayan because he was born in the noble family of \n",
      "Vallam.)\n",
      "But, these chieftains did not bear their titles merely \n",
      "because of their noble birth and thereby enjoy the comforts \n",
      "and indulgence of palace life. Only those men who were \n",
      "able-bodied and brave enough to enter the battle -field \n",
      "could safeguard their titles and territories. Therefore, each \n",
      "of these men had not only participated in several \n",
      "campaigns but they also bore the wounds of such warfare \n",
      "on their bodies. Now, all these men governed their \n",
      "territories or kingdoms under the suzerainty of Emperor \n",
      "Sundara Chozla of Pazlayarai. Many of them were \n",
      "important officials of the Chozla government.\n",
      "Normally, Vandiya Devan would have felt immense \n",
      "elation at having seen all these noblemen in the same \n",
      "place. However, he felt no joy about it. Why have all these \n",
      "men gathered together here? The question occurred to him \n",
      "again and again. All sorts of garbled doubts filled his \n",
      "mind. With his mind filled with such confusion, he sought his \n",
      "bed in the isolated spot re adied by Kandamaran for him. \n",
      "Because the palace was hosting several important \n",
      "dignitaries, a tiny, covered terrace was allotted to him as a \n",
      "bed-chamber. \n",
      "\"You seem to be very tired. Lie down and sleep well. I will \n",
      "take care of the other guests and later c ome to sleep in this \n",
      "terrace itself,\" said Kandamaran before going away.\n",
      "As soon as he lay down, sleep swirled into Vandiya \n",
      "Devan's eyes. Nitra Devi, the Goddess of Sleep took hold \n",
      "of him completely. But what use? There is Mind which \n",
      "cannot be conquered even by the Goddess of Sleep! Even \n",
      "though his body remained still and his eyes stayed tightly \n",
      "shut, thoughts buried deep in the mind blossomed into \n",
      "dreams. Several meaningless incidents, happenings beyond \n",
      "reason took place in that dream world. \n",
      "Somewhere in the distance a lone wolf howled. One wolf \n",
      "became ten wolves; hundred wolves; they all howled \n",
      "together. While howling they came nearer and nearer and \n",
      "nearer. In that pitch darkness their eyes burned like tiny \n",
      "embers. They came closer and closer. Vandiya D evan tried \n",
      "to turn around and run away to escape. But, on the other \n",
      "side there were tens, hundreds, no thousands of dogs --\n",
      "barking loudly, rushing towards him. The eyes of those \n",
      "hunting dogs glowed like embers. What will happen to me \n",
      "if I am caught in between these mad dogs and wolves? \n",
      "thought Vandiya Devan and shivered. \n",
      "Luckily there was a temple right in front. He ran into the \n",
      "temple and pulled the door shut, bolting it hurriedly. When \n",
      "he looked around it seemed to be a temple of the Mother \n",
      "Goddess. A statue of Kali stood there with a horrible face \n",
      "and tongue hanging out.  A priest rose from behind the \n",
      "statue. He held a terrible machete in his hands. \"Oh! You \n",
      "have come,\" he said as he came closer and closer.\n",
      "\"What is the history of your noble family? F or how many \n",
      "generations have your clansmen ruled their kingdom? Tell \n",
      "the truth!\" said the priest.\n",
      "\"The Vallava Rayas of the Vaanar family had ruled for \n",
      "three hundred years. During my father's times we lost all \n",
      "our lands to the Vaithumba kings,\" replied Va ndiya Devan. \n",
      "\"Then you are not the right sacrifice. Run away,\" said the \n",
      "priest with disgust. \n",
      "Suddenly Kali turned into a statue of Krishna! Two \n",
      "delightful maidens came in, singing the psalms of Saint \n",
      "Andal and danced with abandon in front of the statue. \n",
      "While he was enchanted with these sights, he heard the \n",
      "song \"We saw, we saw, we saw things pleasing to the eye,\" \n",
      "behind him. Turning around he saw Azlvar -adiyan Nambi. \n",
      "Yes it was him singing. Oh no. Not him; it was just his \n",
      "head that sang. The severed head  was placed on the \n",
      "sacrificial alter! 6Unable to bear this sight, Vandiya Devan turned away. \n",
      "Upon turning, he banged his head upon the pillar. The \n",
      "dream melted away. Eyes opened. But he saw a sight that \n",
      "seemed to mix reality with dreams.\n",
      "In a spot directly in front of his terrace, he could see the \n",
      "fortress walls of Kadamboor palace; he could see a head \n",
      "on top of these walls. It was the head of that very same \n",
      "Azlvar-adiyan Nambi. This time he realized that it was \n",
      "neither a dream nor a hallucination. Becaus e, however \n",
      "long he stared at it, the head remained there. It was not \n",
      "merely a head, there was a body behind it. He could easily \n",
      "detect both hands of Azlvar -adiyan holding on to the wall. \n",
      "In addition, the fellow was staring rather intensely at \n",
      "something below, inside the wall. \n",
      "What is he looking at so earnestly, inside there? ... There is \n",
      "some kind of deception and intrigue in this. Azlvar -adiyan \n",
      "could not have come here with good intentions. He must \n",
      "have come here with vile plans to perform some evil deed . \n",
      "Is it not my duty, being Kandamaran's dearest friend, to \n",
      "stop this wickedness? How can I sleep in idleness without \n",
      "guarding the house of these folks who have fed and housed \n",
      "me tonight? Vallavarayan jumped up. He picked up a knife \n",
      "in its sheath lying on h is side and stuck it in his waist -\n",
      "band. He walked towards the direction in which he saw \n",
      "Nambi's head.\n",
      "Remember, he was sleeping in a corner of the upper \n",
      "terrace? From there as he walked towards the outer walls \n",
      "of the palace, he had to go around several tu rrets, pillars \n",
      "and decorative rooftops. After walking on for a while he \n",
      "suddenly heard the sound of voices talking somewhere \n",
      "nearby. He hesitated. Hiding himself behind a pillar he \n",
      "peeped down below. \n",
      "In a narrow courtyard enclosed by tall walls he saw ab out \n",
      "ten or twelve men seated comfortably. The towering walls \n",
      "hid the rising moonlight. However, an iron oil -lamp buried \n",
      "in the wall gave some light. All the men seated there were \n",
      "the dignitaries he had met at the banquet earlier; the \n",
      "chieftains and elder officials of the Chozla Empire. \n",
      "They must have gathered in this midnight conference to \n",
      "discuss some important matter. Azlvar -adiyan must be \n",
      "trying to spy upon what they were saying and doing, by \n",
      "hanging on the outer walls. There is no doubt about the \n",
      "fact that Azlvar-adiyan is a very shrewd and clever fellow. \n",
      "From where he was positioned on the wall, Azlvar -adiyan \n",
      "could more or less see all the men seated in conference \n",
      "below. He could hear their talk very well. But the men \n",
      "seated there  could not see Azlva r-adiyan. The courtyard \n",
      "and palace wall were situated in that fashion! Somehow, \n",
      "the fellow had chanced upon such a perfect spot. \n",
      "Capable fellow. No doubt!  But all his cleverness will not \n",
      "work with this Vandiya Devan of the Vaanar clan. \n",
      "Somehow, I must get hold of that masquerading Vaishnava \n",
      "fanatic .... but if I am to catch him, I cannot do so without \n",
      "attracting the attention of the men assembled below. I have to cross the courtyard before I can reach those walls. There \n",
      "may be some danger in crossing the  courtyard in full view \n",
      "of those men.\n",
      "He recalled the words of Sambuvaraya saying \"He need \n",
      "not have come here, today of all days.\" \n",
      "These men are gathered here to discuss something \n",
      "important. It is clear that they do not want anyone to know \n",
      "what their discussions are about. In such a situation if they \n",
      "suddenly see me, they will start suspecting me. By the time \n",
      "I explain about Azlvar-adiyan he would have jumped off \n",
      "the wall and escaped. All that will remain is the doubt \n",
      "about me. If they ask, \"Why did you,  who were supposed \n",
      "to be sleeping, come here?\" what can I reply? I will \n",
      "definitely put Kandamaran in a delicate position. There! \n",
      "Even Kandamaran is part of this meeting; he is seated at \n",
      "the back. If I ask him in the morning I can know all.\n",
      "As these thoughts ran through his mind, Vandiya Devan \n",
      "saw a covered palanquin resting in one corner of the \n",
      "courtyard below him. Is this not the same palanquin that \n",
      "came behind Lord Pazluvoor and his elephant?  That lady \n",
      "who was in it, who parted the curtains to peep outs ide, I \n",
      "wonder where she is now. I believe the old man did not \n",
      "even send her to the women's apartments. This is the \n",
      "predicament if somewhat older men marry very young \n",
      "girls. Suspicion drains their very life. They cannot bear to \n",
      "be parted from their young wi ves even for one moment! \n",
      "Perhaps even now, Pazluvoor's Young -Queen is in this \n",
      "palanquin! Gosh! Look at the fate of this great warrior! At \n",
      "this age, he is enslaved by a slip of a girl and is on tender -\n",
      "hooks. She is not all that great a Rathi, Menaka or Ramb a \n",
      "(heavenly beauties). \n",
      "No, Vandiya Devan had not forgotten the feeling of \n",
      "distaste which he experienced when he had seen her by the \n",
      "roadside. I wonder what this brave Lord Pazluvoor sees in \n",
      "her?  More surprising is this Azlvar -adiyan's madness. \n",
      "Maybe he is waiting on that wall because this palanquin is \n",
      "here. What is the relationship between him and her? How \n",
      "can I know?  Perhaps she is his sister; or maybe his \n",
      "sweetheart. Maybe Lord Pazluvoor forcefully abducted \n",
      "her. He is capable of doing such things. May be this fellow \n",
      "is wandering around trying to find an opportunity to meet \n",
      "her and talk to her. Why should I bother about all this. Let \n",
      "me go back to sleep, thought Vandiya Devan.\n",
      "Just as he made this decision he heard his name being \n",
      "uttered down below. Imm ediately he began to listen with \n",
      "some interest.\n",
      "\"That fellow who came in saying that he was a friend of \n",
      "your son? Where is he sleeping? He should not hear \n",
      "anything that we utter here. Remember that he serves the \n",
      "Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Armies. Till all our \n",
      "plans are complete and the time for action arrives, no one \n",
      "should know about our plans. Even if there is the slightest \n",
      "suspicion that this fellow knows something, he must not be 7let outside this fortress. In fact it would be better to put a \n",
      "complete end to his activities ...\"\n",
      "Our readers can guess how Vandiya Devan felt upon \n",
      "hearing these words. But he did not move away from the \n",
      "spot. He made up his mind to listen to all their talk.\n",
      "Who was the Northern Commander -in-Chief? It was none \n",
      "other than the eldest son of Emperor Sundara Chozla. \n",
      "None other than the Crown Prince, next in line for the \n",
      "throne. Why should these fellows object to my serving that \n",
      "Prince? What is it that they are planning that must be kept \n",
      "secret from the Prince?'\n",
      "At that moment Kandamaran intervened for his friend: \n",
      "\"Vandiya Devan is sleeping peacefully in the corner \n",

      "will not interfere in things that do not concern him. Even if \n",
      "he hears something he will not hinder y our plans in any \n",
      "way. I will be responsible for that.\"\n",
      "\"I am happy that you trust him so much. But none of us \n",
      "know of him or his credentials. That is why I warned you. \n",
      "What we are going to discuss now is about the rights of \n",
      "succession to a large empire. E ven if one whisper gets out \n",
      "because of carelessness it may lead to severe \n",

      "\"What is left to think about now?   Was not Aditya \n",

      "\"It is correct to say that he did not consult any of us. \n",

      "voice, some others of the group laughed.\n",
      "\"Well! You all laugh! I do not know how you can think of \n",
      "laughter. My very heart burns when I think of it; my blood \n",
      "boils. I wonder why I should safeguard my life and live \n",
      "without any sense of shame. The soothsayer who danced in \n",
      "frenzy said that the Goddess is asking for a sacrifice. He \n",
      "asked for a human sacrifice; of a prince from a thousand -\n",
      "year old dynasty. Give me up as the sacrifice. My family is \n",
      "more ancient than a thousand years. With a blow across \n",
      "my throat, each of you with your swords offer me as the 8sacrifice. The Mother Goddess will be satisfied; my soul \n",
      "will be satisfied.\"\n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor spoke the above words with as much rage \n",
      "as the frenzied soothsaying -dancer.\n",
      "Silence prevailed for a short while. The whistling o f the \n",

      "\"I too lost my composure. You should forgive me. Think \n",
      "of one thing. Two hund red years before today, Vijayala \n",

      "captured Tanjore. During the battle of Thiru -puram-biyam, \n",
      "he helped the Pallava army and destroyed the legions of \n",
      "Madurai Pandiya. From that moment, the Chozla Kingdom \n",
      "has been growing and expanding day -by-day. The Chozla's \n",

      "vanquished; you know the reasons ....\"\n",
      "Lord Mazluvoor intervened: \"Yes. All of us know the \n",

      "\"I agree with the reasons given by Lord Mazluvoor. For \n",

      "He is not planning campaigns against the twin territories of \n",
      "the Rashtrakutas or against Vengi (modern Eluru of \n",

      "A laugh was heard in their midst.\n",
      "Lord Sambuvaraya jumped up. \"Who laughed? Let him \n",

      "\"If so, I request Lord Pazluvoor to clear just one more \n",
      "doubt. Why has this palanquin, which should have stayed \n",

      "meeting? Is there someone inside the closed palanquin or \n",
      "not? If there is no one inside, how is it th at I heard \n",

      "true -- we have to decide who is eligible to succeed to the \n",
      "Chozla throne.\"\n",
      "\"We request that you state your opinion on this matter. \n",
      "There is no one here who has anything to say against your \n",

      "\"That is not correct. Each one of you must think and then \n",
      "express an impartial opinion. Permit me to recall some old \n",
      "history to your memories.  Twenty -four years ago, King \n",
      "Gandara Aditya who was a great philosopher and devout \n",
      "soul, died unexpectedly. When he died, his son, \n",
      "Madurandaka, was a one year old child. The Queen -\n",
      "consort of Gandara Aditya, the Lady Sembiyan Madevi, \n",
      "announced to us, the wishes of the King: his younger \n",
      "brother Arinjaya was to accept the Chozla throne after \n",
      "him. Therefore, we crowned Prince Arinjaya as the Chozla \n",
      "monarch. However, fate did not decree that Arinjaya \n",
      "should sit on the throne for more than a year. When \n",
      "Arinjaya died,  his son, Paranth aka Sundara Chozla, was a \n",
      "youth of twenty-four. Considering the welfare of the \n",
      "nation, all of us -- the ministers, advisors, territorial \n",
      "chieftains the heads of all the clans and leaders of the cities \n",
      "and districts -- decided unanimously, and crowned Sunda ra \n",
      "Chozla. None of us had cause to regret this. Because, until \n",
      "two years ago, he ruled the nation with justice; he \n",
      "respected our wishes and opinions and ruled this country \n",
      "lawfully. Because of him the Chozla power grew to \n",
      "include all neighboring nations un der its sway. \n",
      "\"Now, the health of Sundara Chozla is cause for concern. \n",
      "In this situation, who is eligible to succeed the Emperor? \n",
      "Madurandaka, the cherished son of King Gandara Aditya, \n",
      "is now grown up; he has the intelligence, education, the \n",
      "character, the devotion to God, all the qualities of a person \n",
      "worthy of the throne. Sundara Chozla's son, Aditya \n",
      "Karikala, who is younger to him by one year, is stationed \n",
      "in Kanchi as a Commander -in-Chief. Who between these \n",
      "two has the right to succeed to the throne? What is the \n",
      "code of inheritance among the clans? What is the law? \n",
      "What is the ancient tradition of the Tamils? Is it justice if \n",
      "the elder brother's son, Madurandaka inherits the nation? \n",
      "Or, is it legal for the grand -son of the younger brother to \n",
      "succeed? Each of you must consider this and clearly state \n",
      "your decision.\"\n",
      "\"Madurandaka, the son of the elder brother Gandara \n",

      "\"I agree\", \"That is my opinion too,\" so rose se veral voices. \n",
      "\"Your convictions are mine. Madurandaka deserves the \n",
      "throne. However, is everyone here ready to support and \n",
      "further this belief? Are you all ready to sacrifice your lives, \n",
      "your wealth and very soul for this cause? This very minute, \n",
      "are you all ready to swear in the name of Goddess Durga \n",
      "and take an oath of allegiance?\"  When Lord Pazluvoor 1asked this question his voice had a certain harshness, not \n",
      "heard till then.\n",
      "Silence prevailed for some time.  Lord Sambuvaraya then \n",
      "said, \"We are ready to take such an oath of support.  \n",
      "Before that, we need one clarification. What are the \n",
      "feelings of Prince Madurandaka? Is he ready to accept the \n",
      "throne and rule this Empire? We have heard that the \n",
      "cherished son of Gandara Aditya has forsaken the \n",
      "pleasures of worldly life and is fully involved in the \n",
      "devotion and worship of God Shiva. Several persons have \n",
      "said that he has no interest in worldly kingdoms. We have \n",
      "also heard that his mother, the Elder Pirati Sembiyan \n",
      "Madevi is totally opposed to his ascending t he throne. We \n",
      "wish to know the truth about this from you.\"\n",
      "\"A good point and you raised it at the correct time. I must \n",
      "clarify this question. I should have explained earlier --\n",
      "forgive me for not doing so,\" with this long introduction \n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor spoke as follows: \"The whole nation \n",
      "knows that the Lady Sembiyan Madevi discouraged her \n",
      "only son from having any interest in affairs of the state and \n",
      "raised him as a Saiva ascetic. But, neither nation nor \n",
      "people know the reason behind such behavior.  The Elder \n",
      "Pirati feared that his very life would be in danger if her son \n",
      "Madurandaka had any wish to rule the empire ... \"\n",
      "\"Aha! Is that so!\"\n",
      "\"Yes! To any mother, the wish  that the son to whom she \n",
      "gave birth should stay well and alive is greater than a \n",
      "desire that he should sit upon the throne of the Kingdom. \n",
      "Young Prince Madurandaka, who considered the words of \n",
      "his mother as gospel, turned his mind in the path of \n",
      "devotion and asceticism. Nevertheless, for sometime, his \n",
      "mind has slowly undergone some transformatio n. `This \n",
      "Chozla Empire is mine; it is my duty to rule the nation!' \n",
      "such thoughts have taken root and grown in his heart. If he \n",
      "knows that all of you are ready to support his cause, he is \n",
      "ready to come forward at a suitable time and openly \n",
      "declare his intentions.\" \n",
      "\"What proof do we have for this?\"\n",
      "\"I will, without delay, produce proof that will satisfy all of \n",
      "you. If I furnish such proof, will each of you take an oath \n",
      "of allegiance to this cause?\"\n",
      "Several of the men said \"We will! We will!\"\n",
      "\"I hope no one has any other kind of reservation?\"\n",
      "\"No! None!\"\n",
      "\"Then, I shall show proof. I shall also clear the doubts \n",
      "raised by Lord Vananga -mudi Munai Raya.\" With this \n",
      "declaration, Lord Pazluvoor rose from his seat. Walking \n",
      "majestically, he neared the closed pala nquin. \"Prince! Please part the curtains and grace the outside with \n",
      "your appearance. Permit these brave warriors, who are \n",
      "ready to sacrifice their very life, wealth and soul for you, \n",

      "Vandiya Devan, who was sitting behind the pillar on the \n",
      "upper terrace and listening to all these discussions with an \n",
      "overpowering curiosity, now peeped down carefully. As \n",
      "before, a hand parted the curtains of the palanquin. It too \n",
      "was a golden hand. It seemed to be the very same fair hand \n",
      "he had seen once before. But he now realized that he had \n",
      "surmised the golden bracelet worn by royalty to be a \n",
      "bangle. A dazzling face, comparable to the full moon, \n",
      "could be seen the very next instant. A handsome figu re, \n",
      "comparable to Manmatha, the God of Love, stepped out of \n",
      "the palanquin and smiled. \n",
      "Aha! Is this Prince Madurandaka, son of Gandara Aditya \n",
      "Deva?  I mistook him to be a woman? I concluded that it \n",
      "must be a girl, because of the closed palanquin!?  But, d id \n",
      "Azlvar-adiyan Nambi also make the same mistake?  \n",
      "Vandiya Devan looked around to see if Nambi was still \n",
      "thrusting his head above the wall. That spot of the palace \n",
      "wall was now shrouded by shadows cast by the trees. He \n",
      "could see nothing.\n",
      "By now he heard some shouts from below. \"Long Live \n",
      "Madurandaka! Praise the Crown -Prince Madurandaka! \n",
      "Victory to our brave spears!\" They were passionate \n",
      "outbursts. Vandiya Devan saw that all the men in the \n",
      "courtyard were now standing; they held their swords and \n",
      "spears high up above their heads and cheered. Thinking \n",
      "that it would be dangerous to remain any longer in that \n",

      "dry lands north of the River Palar. Consequently, he did \n",
      "not know how to swim in a flowing river. Once, when he \n",
      "was in the army on border patrol along the banks of the \n",
      "North Pennar, he waded into the river for a bath. H e was \n",
      "caught in a swollen whirlpool. That sinister and devilish \n",
      "whirlpool made him go round and round. At the same time \n",
      "it dragged him downwards. Very soon the whirlpool had \n",

      "When he went back to bed that night in Kadamboor, he \n",

      "Until that day, no doubt about Prince Karikala's eligibility \n",

      "\"I have no guest more important than you ...\" saying this \n",
      "Kandamaran stopped suddenly. \"Yes the guests are \n",

      "Vandiya Devan.\n",
      "After more than two hours, both friends mounted on two \n",

      "horses cantered quite slowly. The ride was rather pleasant. \n",
      "The friends did not seem to mind even the road dust \n",
      "sprayed upon them by the swift northern wind. They had \n",

      "Vandiya Devan said: \"Kandamara! Even though I spent \n",
      "just one night in your house, it was very useful to me. Just \n",
      "one disappointment. You used to recount all sorts of things \n",
      "about your sister, while we were on the banks of the North \n",
      "Pennar. I could not even see her properly! When she \n",
      "peeped from hiding behind your mother, I could glimpse \n",

      "a few days on my way back. I can make her acquaintance \n",
      "at that time. By that time your younger sister may be able \n",
      "to overcome her shyness about me. Kandamara, what is \n",
      "your sister's name?\"\n",
      "\"Manimekala.\"\n",
      "\"Oh! What a delightful name! If her character and beauty \n",
      "are like the name...\"\n",
      "Kandamaran intervened and said in a forlorn voice, \"My \n",
      "friend! I beg this one thing of you. Please forget my sister. \n",
      "Please forget all that I mentioned about her to you. Do not \n",
      "even utter her name.\"\n",
      "\"What is this Kandamara? Every thing seems topsy -turvy? \n",
      "Even last night you hinted that I may become a son -in-law \n",
      "to your clan!\"\n",
      "\"It is true that I said it. Since then the situation has \n",
      "changed. My parents have arranged to wed my young \n",
      "sister elsewhere. Manimekala has also agreed.\"\n",
      "Vandiya Devan cheered within his heart: \"Long live \n",
      "Manimekala.\" He did not have any trouble guessing who \n",
      "was selected to wed Manimekala. They must have pledged \n",
      "her to Madurandaka who stepped out of the closed \n",
      "palanquin. They are perhaps arranging such marriage \n",
      "alliances in order to gain strength for the Prince's cause. \n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor is a dangerous and capable politician.\n",

      "\"Expected? How is that?\"\n",
      "\"Who would give their daughter to a destitute -orphan like \n",

      "ancestors had ruled kingdoms long ago?\"\n",
      "\"My dear friend! Enough of this, stop!  Don't think so \n",
      "shoddily of me or my family. What you think, is not the \n",

       "' The Gypsy Dance\\nBoth friends came out from the inner chambers.  A voice \\nfrom inside called out, \"Kandamara! Kandamara!\"\\n\"My mother is calling me. Wait right here. I\\'ll be back \\ninstantly,\" said Kandamaran as he went inside once again. \\nThe voices of several women talking all at once, the sound \\nof questions being asked one upon the other and \\nKandamaran answering them with some  confusion could \\nbe heard. He also heard the women inside laughing gaily. \\nThe thought that they were perhaps laughing at him caused \\nsome shame and anger in Vandiya Devan. When \\nKandamaran came out, he took hold of his friend\\'s hand \\nand dragged him onwards s aying, \"Come let us look \\naround our palace.\" \\nHe showed him all the beautiful moonlit terraces, music \\nrooms, dance halls, storage rooms, well furnished \\nchambers, living quarters, audience halls, turrets, towers, \\nstables and other places. After a while Van diya Devan \\nasked, \"Kandamara, you made me wait outside your \\nmother\\'s chambers and went in again. At that time what \\nwas so special to provoke the laughter and joy inside? \\nWere the women so happy to see me, your friend?\"\\n\"They were all very happy to meet yo u. In fact my mother \\nand others liked you a lot. But they were not laughing \\nabout you ...\"\\n\"Then why the laughter?\"3\"You know the Lord of Pazluvoor? At this age, after all \\nthese years he has recently married a very young girl. He \\nhas brought her here in a covered palanquin. Apparently he \\nhas kept her locked up in his own chambers without \\nsending her to the inner apartments in the palace. One of \\nthe maids who saw the girl by peeping in through the \\nwindow, came and described her beauty. That is the cause \\nfor the laughter.  They were discussing if she was a \\nSinghala girl, a Kalinga lady or perhaps a maid from \\nChera. You know that the ancestors of the Pazluvoor clan \\noriginally came here from the Chera country?\"\\n\"I have heard it too. Perhaps you had told me ea rlier. \\nThat\\'s OK! Kandamara, how long is it since Lord \\nPazluvoor married this mysterious beauty?\"\\n\"It must be less than two years. He has not left her alone \\nfor even a short while from the time he married her! He \\ntakes his ladylove along wherever he goes;  in a closed \\npalanquin! In fact there has been a lot of sniggering about \\nit all over the country. Vandiya Deva, won\\'t there be \\nridicule and derision if men who are past a certain age get \\ninvolved in such entanglements with women?\"\\n\"I do not think that is the reason. Kandamara, shall I tell \\nyou the real reason for the laughter? Generally women are \\nenvious. Don\\'t think I am belittling the women in your \\nfamily. All womankind is like that! The women of your \\nhousehold are dark-colored beauties. However, Lord \\nPazluvoor\\'s beloved is rosily -fair and golden hued. That is \\nwhy these women do not like her; they are making up \\nstories about her...!\"\\n\"Hey! What is this wonder? How do you know about her \\ncomplexion? Why, have you seen her? Where? How did \\nyou see her? If Lord Pazluvoor knows of this, your life is \\nnot yours!\"\\n\"Kandamara, I am not afraid of all that. You know it. \\nMoreover, I have not done anything improper. I was \\nwatching, one among the crowd on the roadside, when \\nLord Pazluvoor and his retinue went past. The  elephant, \\nhorses, livery, footmen, drummers -- I believe all these \\nwere honors sent by your family to receive him. Is that \\ntrue?\"\\n\"Yes we had sent all those accolades. So what ...?\"\\n\"So what? Nothing. I was just comparing the reception that \\nyou accorded to Lord Pazluvoor and the welcome given to \\nme; nothing else ...\"\\nKandamaran laughed lightly, \"We gave him the tribute and \\nhonor due to the official who levies taxes. A welcome \\nappropriate to a great warrior was given to you! Sometime, \\nwith God Muruga\\'s grace, when you become the son -in-\\nlaw to our house we shall give you the honors due to a \\nbridegroom and welcome you.\" He then added, \"But, you were about to say something \\nelse; we were sidetracked. Oh yes! You were saying that \\nLord Pazluvoor\\'s beloved was  very fair and light in color. \\nHow did you know that?\"\\n\"Lord Pazluvoor was coming seated on the dark, huge \\nelephant from Kadamboor Fort: like Yama, the God of \\nJustice seated upon a huge water -buffalo! All my thoughts \\nwere concentrated on him. While I was building dream-\\nempires about one day becoming famous and powerful like \\nhim, a covered palanquin followed him. Even as I \\nwondered about who could come in a covered palanquin, a \\nhand from inside parted the curtains. I could barely see the \\nface within. The hand and face were golden -hued. That \\nwas all I saw. From what you said just now, I realize that \\nshe must be the beloved of Lord Pazluvoor.\"\\n\"Vandiya Deva, you are a lucky fellow! It is being said \\nthat no man has glimpsed upon that Young -Queen of \\nPazluvoor. You could at least see her hand and face for a \\nsecond. From what you saw, can you guess anything about \\nthe nation which gave birth to that beauty?\" asked \\nKandamaran.\\n\"I did not ponder about it at that time. Now that I think of \\nit, she is perhaps a woman f rom the Kashmir country; or \\nshe is a beauty who hails from the distant lands across the \\nsea like Java, Kadaram (Malaya), Yavana (Greece -Rome). \\nMaybe she is a princess from Arabia: I believe that women \\nin that country are hidden behind veils from birth till\\ndeath.\"\\nAt that moment, the sound of musical instruments could be \\nheard somewhere nearby. Several kinds of drums, flutes, \\npipes and instruments like salli, karadi, parai, udukku  \\nwere being tuned together. \"What is that noise?\" asked \\nVallavarayan.\\n\"The Kuravai Koothu (gypsy dance) is about to begin. The \\ndrums and flutes are being tuned in preparation. Would \\nyou like to watch the gypsy dance? Or, would you like to \\neat early and sleep well?\" \\nVandiya Devan recalled Azlvar -adiyan mentioning the \\ngypsy dance. \"I have never seen the gypsy dance; I must \\nsurely see it,\" he said.\\nWhen they walked ahead a little and turned, they could see \\nthe stage being set for the dancers. The guests were \\ngathering in front of the stage. The stage for the gypsy \\ndance was set in a wide courtyard spread with clean -white \\nsand and situated in a spot surrounded by the palace walls \\nand the towering battlements of the fort. The stage was \\ndecorated with colorful drawings of cocks, peacocks, \\nswans and parrots. They had further decked the  stage with \\nseveral fragrant flower garlands, red -rice popped white, \\ncolored millet, yellow turmeric and other powders, \\nkunrimani (small red berry -beads), and other vivid \\ndecorations.  Tall oil-lamps and flaming torches tried to \\ndrive the darkness away. Bu t the swirling fragrance from 4smoldering frankincense and smokey torches created a \\nmisty screen dimming the lights.  The musicians sat on \\nboth sides and in front of the stage and played their \\ninstruments with gusto. The fragrant flowers, sweet \\nsmelling incense and the drum beats all together made \\nVandiya Devan feel light -headed.\\nAfter all the important guests were seated, the nine \\nmaidens who were to perform the gypsy dance came on \\nthe stage. They wore the tight fitting clothes and \\nornaments suitable for d ancing; they had bell-filled anklets \\non their feet; brilliant red hued flowers of the hill country, \\nflowers favored by the God Muruga, decorated their \\nhairstyles. A long garland woven with such flowers thrown \\nupon their shoulders, seemed to bind them to ea ch other as \\nthey stood upon the stage. In their hands they daintily \\ngrasped beautiful parrots made of sandalwood painted a \\nvivid green.\\nAfter greeting the audience they began to sing and dance. \\nThey first sang a few verses in praise of God Muruga. \\nThey sang of the brave deeds of Muruga; and they sang of \\nhis victorious spear which killed the demons Soora -padma \\nand Gaja-mukha and then dried up the vast ocean. They \\nsang of how he chose for his bride, a maid from the Tamil \\ncountry, a gypsy maid from the hills who was guarding the \\nmillet fields, even as heavenly nymphs offered prayers to \\nmarry the young warrior -God. Their song celebrated the \\ngrace and benevolence of Velan, i.e., Murugan who bears \\nthe spear. The lyrical songs, the fast paced dance, the quick \\ndrum-beats, enchanting flute all in combination bewitched \\nthose who were watching. With the following words of \\nprayer the dance concluded:\\nLet hunger and disease be destroyed;Let enmity be routed;Let rain and fertility increase;Let bounty grow boundless.\\nThe maidens stepped off the stage and moved away.\\nNext, a man and woman dressed as oracles -- thevar-aalan \\nand thevar-aati,  came on stage. The divine -man and \\ndivine-woman wore blood-red clothes. They had brilliant \\ngarlands made of blood -red oleander flowers. They had \\npainted their foreheads with bright red kumkum powders. \\nEven their lips seemed blood -red because they had chewed \\nthe betel leaf and areca -nut. Their eyes seemed blood -shot! \\nThe Velan Attam or oracle dance, began calmly enough. \\nThey danced by themselves and with arms linked together. \\nAs time passed the tempo and passion increased. The \\ndivine-woman picked up a spear from the side. The man \\ntried to pry it from her hands; and she would not let go. \\nThe dance became more frenzied: finally the man leaped \\nacross the resonating stage, jumping high, he plucked the \\nspear from his companion. With an expression of fear on \\nher face she moved away behind the screens.\\nThe divine-man now danced all by himself with more and \\nmore rapid movements. He acted the part of the God Velan killing the demon Soora. Soora\\'s head was chopped off \\nrepeatedly. But the severed -head grew back again and \\nagain. Velan grew angrier and angrier as the head came \\nback again and again. Sparks flew from his eyes. In the \\nend Soora fell dead. Thevar-aalan threw his spear down.\\nBy now all musical instruments were quiet. Only the little \\nhand-held drum, the udukku could be heard. A priest stood \\nnear the stage fanatically beating the hand -drum. Each part \\nof Thevar-aalan\\'s body shuddered. Thos e in the audience \\nwhispered to each other: \"The spirit has materialized.\" \\nSoon the priest looked at the frenzied Thevar -aalan and \\nsaid, \"Vela! Muruga! Commander of the Gods! Lord who \\nkilled Soora! Please reveal your divine predictions to us, \\nyour devotees.\"\\n\"Ask fellow! Ask whatever you want! I will reveal all!\" \\nreplied the delirious man. \"Will the rains be good? Shall \\nwe have plenty of water? Will the land be bountiful? Will \\nour desires be fulfilled?\" asked the priest.\\n\"The rains will be in season. The  waters would be \\nabundant. The land will be fruitful and desires will be \\nfulfilled! But you have not made offerings to my Mother! \\nThe Goddess desires a sacrifice. The Mother -Goddess \\nwants a sacrifice!\" shouted the dancer in delirium.\\n\"What sacrifice?\" asked the priest.\\n\"Will it be offered if I ask?\"\\n\"Yes, we will offer it. We shall surely offer the sacrifice.\"\\n\"She wants the blood of royalty! She thirsts for the blood \\nof a prince from a thousand year -old dynasty!\" shouted the \\nfrenzied dancer in a horrib le voice. \\nThe dignitaries seated in front of the stage -- Lord \\nPazluvoor, Lord of Mazluvoor, Lord Sambuvaraya and \\nothers, they looked at each other. Their eyes seemed to talk \\na secret language. Lord Sambuvaraya seemed to make a \\nsign to the priest.\\nThe priest stopped beating his hand -drum. The dancer \\ndropped upon the stage like a felled tree. The woman \\ndancer ran in to help him out. The audience dispersed \\nsilently. Somewhere outside, the howling of wolves could \\nbe heard.\\nVandiya Devan, who had been watch ing all this with some \\nagitation, looked towards the direction in which the \\nhowling wolves were heard. There, atop the outer ramparts \\nof the fortress, he saw a head! \\nIt was Azlvar-adiyan\\'s head. For a second he was subject \\nto a horrifying feeling. It app eared as if the severed head of \\nAzlvar-adiyan had been placed upon those walls. He \\nblinked his eyelids to look again: the head was no longer \\nthere! He felt ashamed about the worthless fear that had 5taken hold of him. Several other emotions beyond his \\nexperience seemed to agitate his thoughts.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n'"

       "' The Gypsy Dance\\nBoth friends came out from the inner chambers.  A voice \\nfrom inside called out, \"Kandamara! Kandamara!\"\\n\"My mother is calling me. Wait right here. I\\'ll be back \\ninstantly,\" said Kandamaran as he went inside once again. \\nThe voices of several women talking all at once, the sound \\nof questions being asked one upon the other and \\nKandamaran answering them with some  confusion could \\nbe heard. He also heard the women inside laughing gaily. \\nThe thought that they were perhaps laughing at him caused \\nsome shame and anger in Vandiya Devan. When \\nKandamaran came out, he took hold of his friend\\'s hand \\nand dragged him onwards s aying, \"Come let us look \\naround our palace.\" \\nHe showed him all the beautiful moonlit terraces, music \\nrooms, dance halls, storage rooms, well furnished \\nchambers, living quarters, audience halls, turrets, towers, \\nstables and other places. After a while Van diya Devan \\nasked, \"Kandamara, you made me wait outside your \\nmother\\'s chambers and went in again. At that time what \\nwas so special to provoke the laughter and joy inside? \\nWere the women so happy to see me, your friend?\"\\n\"They were all very happy to meet yo u. In fact my mother \\nand others liked you a lot. But they were not laughing \\nabout you ...\"\\n\"Then why the laughter?\"3\"You know the Lord of Pazluvoor? At this age, after all \\nthese years he has recently married a very young girl. He \\nhas brought her here in a covered palanquin. Apparently he \\nhas kept her locked up in his own chambers without \\nsending her to the inner apartments in the palace. One of \\nthe maids who saw the girl by peeping in through the \\nwindow, came and described her beauty. That is the cause \\nfor the laughter.  They were discussing if she was a \\nSinghala girl, a Kalinga lady or perhaps a maid from \\nChera. You know that the ancestors of the Pazluvoor clan \\noriginally came here from the Chera country?\"\\n\"I have heard it too. Perhaps you had told me ea rlier. \\nThat\\'s OK! Kandamara, how long is it since Lord \\nPazluvoor married this mysterious beauty?\"\\n\"It must be less than two years. He has not left her alone \\nfor even a short while from the time he married her! He \\ntakes his ladylove along wherever he goes;  in a closed \\npalanquin! In fact there has been a lot of sniggering about \\nit all over the country. Vandiya Deva, won\\'t there be \\nridicule and derision if men who are past a certain age get \\ninvolved in such entanglements with women?\"\\n\"I do not think that is the reason. Kandamara, shall I tell \\nyou the real reason for the laughter? Generally women are \\nenvious. Don\\'t think I am belittling the women in your \\nfamily. All womankind is like that! The women of your \\nhousehold are dark-colored beauties. However, Lord \\nPazluvoor\\'s beloved is rosily -fair and golden hued. That is \\nwhy these women do not like her; they are making up \\nstories about her...!\"\\n\"Hey! What is this wonder? How do you know about her \\ncomplexion? Why, have you seen her? Where? How did \\nyou see her? If Lord Pazluvoor knows of this, your life is \\nnot yours!\"\\n\"Kandamara, I am not afraid of all that. You know it. \\nMoreover, I have not done anything improper. I was \\nwatching, one among the crowd on the roadside, when \\nLord Pazluvoor and his retinue went past. The  elephant, \\nhorses, livery, footmen, drummers -- I believe all these \\nwere honors sent by your family to receive him. Is that \\ntrue?\"\\n\"Yes we had sent all those accolades. So what ...?\"\\n\"So what? Nothing. I was just comparing the reception that \\nyou accorded to Lord Pazluvoor and the welcome given to \\nme; nothing else ...\"\\nKandamaran laughed lightly, \"We gave him the tribute and \\nhonor due to the official who levies taxes. A welcome \\nappropriate to a great warrior was given to you! Sometime, \\nwith God Muruga\\'s grace, when you become the son -in-\\nlaw to our house we shall give you the honors due to a \\nbridegroom and welcome you.\" He then added, \"But, you were about to say something \\nelse; we were sidetracked. Oh yes! You were saying that \\nLord Pazluvoor\\'s beloved was  very fair and light in color. \\nHow did you know that?\"\\n\"Lord Pazluvoor was coming seated on the dark, huge \\nelephant from Kadamboor Fort: like Yama, the God of \\nJustice seated upon a huge water -buffalo! All my thoughts \\nwere concentrated on him. While I was building dream-\\nempires about one day becoming famous and powerful like \\nhim, a covered palanquin followed him. Even as I \\nwondered about who could come in a covered palanquin, a \\nhand from inside parted the curtains. I could barely see the \\nface within. The hand and face were golden -hued. That \\nwas all I saw. From what you said just now, I realize that \\nshe must be the beloved of Lord Pazluvoor.\"\\n\"Vandiya Deva, you are a lucky fellow! It is being said \\nthat no man has glimpsed upon that Young -Queen of \\nPazluvoor. You could at least see her hand and face for a \\nsecond. From what you saw, can you guess anything about \\nthe nation which gave birth to that beauty?\" asked \\nKandamaran.\\n\"I did not ponder about it at that time. Now that I think of \\nit, she is perhaps a woman f rom the Kashmir country; or \\nshe is a beauty who hails from the distant lands across the \\nsea like Java, Kadaram (Malaya), Yavana (Greece -Rome). \\nMaybe she is a princess from Arabia: I believe that women \\nin that country are hidden behind veils from birth till\\ndeath.\"\\nAt that moment, the sound of musical instruments could be \\nheard somewhere nearby. Several kinds of drums, flutes, \\npipes and instruments like salli, karadi, parai, udukku  \\nwere being tuned together. \"What is that noise?\" asked \\nVallavarayan.\\n\"The Kuravai Koothu (gypsy dance) is about to begin. The \\ndrums and flutes are being tuned in preparation. Would \\nyou like to watch the gypsy dance? Or, would you like to \\neat early and sleep well?\" \\nVandiya Devan recalled Azlvar -adiyan mentioning the \\ngypsy dance. \"I have never seen the gypsy dance; I must \\nsurely see it,\" he said.\\nWhen they walked ahead a little and turned, they could see \\nthe stage being set for the dancers. The guests were \\ngathering in front of the stage. The stage for the gypsy \\ndance was set in a wide courtyard spread with clean -white \\nsand and situated in a spot surrounded by the palace walls \\nand the towering battlements of the fort. The stage was \\ndecorated with colorful drawings of cocks, peacocks, \\nswans and parrots. They had further decked the  stage with \\nseveral fragrant flower garlands, red -rice popped white, \\ncolored millet, yellow turmeric and other powders, \\nkunrimani (small red berry -beads), and other vivid \\ndecorations.  Tall oil-lamps and flaming torches tried to \\ndrive the darkness away. Bu t the swirling fragrance from 4smoldering frankincense and smokey torches created a \\nmisty screen dimming the lights.  The musicians sat on \\nboth sides and in front of the stage and played their \\ninstruments with gusto. The fragrant flowers, sweet \\nsmelling incense and the drum beats all together made \\nVandiya Devan feel light -headed.\\nAfter all the important guests were seated, the nine \\nmaidens who were to perform the gypsy dance came on \\nthe stage. They wore the tight fitting clothes and \\nornaments suitable for d ancing; they had bell-filled anklets \\non their feet; brilliant red hued flowers of the hill country, \\nflowers favored by the God Muruga, decorated their \\nhairstyles. A long garland woven with such flowers thrown \\nupon their shoulders, seemed to bind them to ea ch other as \\nthey stood upon the stage. In their hands they daintily \\ngrasped beautiful parrots made of sandalwood painted a \\nvivid green.\\nAfter greeting the audience they began to sing and dance. \\nThey first sang a few verses in praise of God Muruga. \\nThey sang of the brave deeds of Muruga; and they sang of \\nhis victorious spear which killed the demons Soora -padma \\nand Gaja-mukha and then dried up the vast ocean. They \\nsang of how he chose for his bride, a maid from the Tamil \\ncountry, a gypsy maid from the hills who was guarding the \\nmillet fields, even as heavenly nymphs offered prayers to \\nmarry the young warrior -God. Their song celebrated the \\ngrace and benevolence of Velan, i.e., Murugan who bears \\nthe spear. The lyrical songs, the fast paced dance, the quick \\ndrum-beats, enchanting flute all in combination bewitched \\nthose who were watching. With the following words of \\nprayer the dance concluded:\\nLet hunger and disease be destroyed;Let enmity be routed;Let rain and fertility increase;Let bounty grow boundless.\\nThe maidens stepped off the stage and moved away.\\nNext, a man and woman dressed as oracles -- thevar-aalan \\nand thevar-aati,  came on stage. The divine -man and \\ndivine-woman wore blood-red clothes. They had brilliant \\ngarlands made of blood -red oleander flowers. They had \\npainted their foreheads with bright red kumkum powders. \\nEven their lips seemed blood -red because they had chewed \\nthe betel leaf and areca -nut. Their eyes seemed blood -shot! \\nThe Velan Attam or oracle dance, began calmly enough. \\nThey danced by themselves and with arms linked together. \\nAs time passed the tempo and passion increased. The \\ndivine-woman picked up a spear from the side. The man \\ntried to pry it from her hands; and she would not let go. \\nThe dance became more frenzied: finally the man leaped \\nacross the resonating stage, jumping high, he plucked the \\nspear from his companion. With an expression of fear on \\nher face she moved away behind the screens.\\nThe divine-man now danced all by himself with more and \\nmore rapid movements. He acted the part of the God Velan killing the demon Soora. Soora\\'s head was chopped off \\nrepeatedly. But the severed -head grew back again and \\nagain. Velan grew angrier and angrier as the head came \\nback again and again. Sparks flew from his eyes. In the \\nend Soora fell dead. Thevar-aalan threw his spear down.\\nBy now all musical instruments were quiet. Only the little \\nhand-held drum, the udukku could be heard. A priest stood \\nnear the stage fanatically beating the hand -drum. Each part \\nof Thevar-aalan\\'s body shuddered. Thos e in the audience \\nwhispered to each other: \"The spirit has materialized.\" \\nSoon the priest looked at the frenzied Thevar -aalan and \\nsaid, \"Vela! Muruga! Commander of the Gods! Lord who \\nkilled Soora! Please reveal your divine predictions to us, \\nyour devotees.\"\\n\"Ask fellow! Ask whatever you want! I will reveal all!\" \\nreplied the delirious man. \"Will the rains be good? Shall \\nwe have plenty of water? Will the land be bountiful? Will \\nour desires be fulfilled?\" asked the priest.\\n\"The rains will be in season. The  waters would be \\nabundant. The land will be fruitful and desires will be \\nfulfilled! But you have not made offerings to my Mother! \\nThe Goddess desires a sacrifice. The Mother -Goddess \\nwants a sacrifice!\" shouted the dancer in delirium.\\n\"What sacrifice?\" asked the priest.\\n\"Will it be offered if I ask?\"\\n\"Yes, we will offer it. We shall surely offer the sacrifice.\"\\n\"She wants the blood of royalty! She thirsts for the blood \\nof a prince from a thousand year -old dynasty!\" shouted the \\nfrenzied dancer in a horrib le voice. \\nThe dignitaries seated in front of the stage -- Lord \\nPazluvoor, Lord of Mazluvoor, Lord Sambuvaraya and \\nothers, they looked at each other. Their eyes seemed to talk \\na secret language. Lord Sambuvaraya seemed to make a \\nsign to the priest.\\nThe priest stopped beating his hand -drum. The dancer \\ndropped upon the stage like a felled tree. The woman \\ndancer ran in to help him out. The audience dispersed \\nsilently. Somewhere outside, the howling of wolves could \\nbe heard.\\nVandiya Devan, who had been watch ing all this with some \\nagitation, looked towards the direction in which the \\nhowling wolves were heard. There, atop the outer ramparts \\nof the fortress, he saw a head! \\nIt was Azlvar-adiyan\\'s head. For a second he was subject \\nto a horrifying feeling. It app eared as if the severed head of \\nAzlvar-adiyan had been placed upon those walls. He \\nblinked his eyelids to look again: the head was no longer \\nthere! He felt ashamed about the worthless fear that had 5taken hold of him. Several other emotions beyond his \\nexperience seemed to agitate his thoughts.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n'"

       "' Aadi FestivalWe welcome our readers to get into the boat of imagination and go sailing down the flood of sourceless, endless time. Let us travel a century for every second and quickly reach the times of a thousand years before the present.In the southern end of Thirumunaipadi, which lies in between the Thondai Kin gdom and the Chozla Kingdom, about two leagues far to the west of Thillai Chittrambalam, (Chidambaram Town) there spreads an ocean -like reservoir. It is known as Veera Narayana Lake. It is about a league and a half long north to south and about half a league wide east to west. Time has twisted its name: for these days the reservoir is known as Veeraanatthu Lake.   In the windy months of Aadi -Aavani (August), when new floods fill the reservoir to almost overflow, anyone who looks at the Veera Narayana lake  will surely recall with pride and astonishment the splendid deeds of our ancestors in Tamil Nadu. Did those ancients do things merely for the welfare of themselves and the people of their own times? ... They fulfilled tasks that would benefit thousands offuture generations in their sacred motherland. On the 18th day of the month of Aadi, in the early hours of the evening, a young warrior, mounted on a horse, was riding down the banks of this ocean -like Veera Narayana Lake. He belonged to the Vaanar clan  which is famous in the history of the gallant Tamils. Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan was his name. Having travelled a long distance and being worn and weary, his horse was walking along rather slowly. The young cavalier did not seem concerned about this. Th e sprawling reservoir had so enchanted his heart!It was common for rivers of the Chozla Kingdom to run with flood waters touching both banks during the Aadi month festival of Padhinettam Perukku. The lakes fed by these rivers would also be filled to capa city, with waves jostling and colliding upon their embankments. Waters from the river called North Cauvery by the devout, but commonly known as Kollidam, rushed into the Veera Narayana Lake, through the Vadavaru stream and made it a turbulent sea.Seventy four floodgates on the lake distributed the bounty via aqueducts to distant tracts of the country side. With these irrigation waters from the lake, activities such as ploughing, sowing and seed transplanting were being carried out as far as the eye could see.Here and there, the song of farmers who were ploughing and women who were transplanting created a pleasant and joyous music. Listening to all this, Vandiya Devan was riding quite slowly, without prodding his tired horse. As soon as he had climbed the  embankment, he had started counting the floodgates with the intention of finding out if popular claims, which declared the lake to have seventy -four floodgates, were true! After having come about one and a half leagues along the bank, he had counted seven ty gates.Aha! How huge is this lake? How wide and how long? Can we not say that the tanks built by the great Pallava monarchs in the Thondai Kingdom are mere ponds and pools compared with this immense reservoir? Did not Prince Raja-aditya son of King Paranthaka who conquered Madurai, think of building this great tank to conserve the waters of the North Cauvery which were going wastefully into the sea? And did he not execute his thinking into action? How great a genius he must have been! Who can we compare to his brave nobility! During the battle at Takkolam, did he not, riding an elephant go to the forefront and single handed, enter combat? And in the course of that confrontation did he not receive enemy spears on his chest and give up his very life? And b ecause of it did he not get the title Deva who reposed atop the elephant as he departed for the heavens meant for the brave? These kings of the Chozla Dynasty are remarkable! They were just as just as they were brave! And as in justice they excelled in the veneration of their Gods. Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan\\'s shoulders swelled with pride when he thought of his good fortune in having received the friendship of a Chozla prince of such a dynasty. Just like the waves that dashed against the banks of the lake because of the swift western breeze, his heart too bubbled with gratification and pride. Thinking all such thoughts Vandiya Devan reached the southern end of Veera Narayana Lake. There he could view the panorama of the Vadavaru stream separating from the North Cauvery and falling into the lake. For a short distance inside the embankment, the lake shore was silted forming a sandy beach. A number of casuarina trees and wood -apple trees had been planted on the beach so that rising flood waters would not des troy the embankment. Nanal reeds had grown thickly along the water\\'s edge. From a distance, the scenic view of the rushing waters from the tree lined North River merging into the lake in the south -west, seemed like a colorful, newly created painting. Vandi ya Devan saw a few other things that increased the pleasing joyousness of this enchanting scene. Was it not the day of the Aadi Festival? Crowds of people from nearby villages, dragging their carts covered with canopies of sandal -colored, supple coconut-leaves, were coming there. Men, women, children and even several elderly folks all wearing new clothes and vividly dressed in various ways had come. Bunches of fragrant flowers, such as the hearts of country cactus, chrysanthemum, jasmine, gardenia, champaka  and iruvatchi decorated the braids of women. Several had come with families bringing stewed rice and fancy picnic foods. Some stood by the water\\'s edge and ate their picnic rice-dishes from platters of plantain -flower petals. Others, more brave, had ven tured further into the water to cross over to the bank of the Vadavaru. Some children threw the platters from which they had eaten into the floodgates and clapped their hands with laughter to see the petals float through the gates to be rushed onto the canals. Some mischievous young men plucked the flowers off the heads of their loved ones and threw them into the water, merely to see them being cast upon the shore. Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan stood there watching all this for a while. He listened with an e ager ear when some of the girls with pleasant voices sang. They sang traditional boat-songs and flood-songs as well as folk songs like Kummi and Sindhu.Come, oh ye young maidens,  Look at the North river bubbling by!Come watch, oh ye friends, Look at the White river rushing by!Come, oh come all ye girls, To look at the Cauvery tumbling by!Such flood-songs pleasingly flooded the ears of Vandiya Devan. Others sang ballads about the bravery and fame of Chozla kings. Some girls sang of Vijayala Chozl a who had fought in thirty-two battles and had worn his ninety -six body wounds like ornaments. Others sang acclaiming the bravery of his son, Aditya Chozla, and how he constructed sixty-four Shiva temples all along the Cauvery - from where it rose till it mingled into the sea. One girl sang the fame of King Aditya\\'s son, Paranthaka Chozla, who had not only conquered the Pandiya, Pallava and Chera kings but had also sent an army to Lanka to hoist his victory flag. When each girl sang, several people stood ar ound her listening with rapt attention. They applauded with loud shouts of \"Ah, ah\" and expressed their happiness!An elderly woman noticed Vandiya Devan who was sitting on his horse and listening to all this. \"Thambi! You seem to have come from a long di stance; you are tired! Come down from your horse to eat this stewed rice,\" she said.Immediately several young girls noticed our youthful traveller. They whispered amongst themselves about his appearance and laughed merrily. Vandiya Devan was overcome by a certain mortification on one side and delight on the other. For a moment he considered dismounting and eating the food offered by the old woman. If he did so, the young maids would surely gather around to tease and laugh. So what? Is it easy to behold so many beautiful maidens in one place? Even their laughter and teasing would be heavenly music. In Vandiya Devan\\'s eyes all those girls on the lake shore appeared like the heavenly nymphs Ramba and Menaka!At the same time he noticed something towards th e south-west along the flow of River Vadavaru and hesitated. About seven or eight large boats with white, spreading sails filled with the breeze were coming swiftly like white swans floating with wide -spread wings. All the people engaged in various merri ments turned to avidly look in the direction from which the boats were coming. One of the boats came forward more swiftly and reached the lake shore where the embankment turned west. Several well-built footmen carrying sharp & shiny spears were in that boat. Some of them jumped on to the lake shore and started shoving the people with shouts of \"Go! Move!\" Before being pushed around too much, the people picked up their containers and belongings and quickly started climbing upon the bank. Vandiya Devan could not understand any of this. Who were these men? Who were coming in the sailboats behind them? Where were they coming from? Perhaps they belonged to the royal household?Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan approached an elderly man leaning upon his cane by the bank . \"Sir, whose men are these? And whose boats are those coming behind like a school of swans? Why are these footmen chasing away the people? And why are the people hurrying away?\" came his questions, one upon the other.\"Thambi! Do you not know? There is a  flag flying in the middle of those sailboats. See what is embossed on it!\" said the elder.\"Seems like a palm tree.\"\"It is a palm tree! Don\\'t you know that the palmtree -flag belongs to the Lord of Pazluvoor?\"\"Is it the great warrior, Lord Pazluvoor, who is coming?\" asked Vandiya Devan in a startled voice.\"It must be so. Who else could raise the palmtree -flag and come?\" said the elderly man.Vandiya Devan\\'s eyes opened wide with immeasurable surprise as he looked towards the boats. Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan had heard much about Lord Pazluvoor. But, who would not have heard about them? The names of the brothers - The Elder Lord Pazluvoor and The Younger Lord Pazluvoor -- were renowned from Lanka in the south to the Kalinga Kingdom in the north. Pazlu voor, situated on the northern banks of the Cauvery near the city of Uraiyoor was their capital. Even from the times of Vijayala Chozla, the Pazluvoor Family had won heroic fame. They had a lot of give and take with the royal family of the Chozlas. Because  of this and also because of their nobility, bravery and fame the Pazluvoor clan had all the distinguishing characters of a royal family. They also had the right to carry their own pennant.The elder of the present Lords of Pazluvoor had fought in twenty-four campaigns.  During his times he had won acclaim as having no equal in war in the Chozla Kingdom. Since he had now crossed the age of fifty, he no longer entered the battlefield directly. Nevertheless, he now held several eminent positions in the gover nment of the Chozlas. In the Chozla Empire, he was the head of finance; head of food supply.  He had the authority to levy taxes according to political needs. He had the right to call upon any princeling, nobleman or squire and order them thus: \"This year you shall pay this much tribute\" and the powers to implement such orders. Therefore, next to Emperor Sundara Chozla he was the most powerful man in the Chozla Kingdom.Vandiya Devan\\'s heart brimmed with an eagerness to meet this powerful, illustrious and noble Lord of Pazluvoor. At the same time he recalled the words uttered in privacy by Prince Aditya Karikala, at the new Golden Palace in Kanchi City.\"Vandiya Deva, I know you to be a brave man. At the same time I trust you to be intelligent and give you  this immense responsibility. Of the two letters I have given you, deliver one to my father the Emperor and the other to my sister the Younger Pirati. (Pirati is the term used to refer to princesses of the ruling house.) I hear all sorts of rumors about even the senior officials of the kingdom in Tanjore.  Therefore, the contents of my letters should not become known to anyone. Even the most eminent persons should not realize that you are carrying letters from me. Do not get into quarrels with anyone on the  way. You should not merely avoid conflicts of your seeking; but also not be involved in disputes thrust upon you. I very well know about your courage. You have proved it several times. Therefore, there shall be no loss of valor in escaping from duels forced upon you. Most important, you should be particularly careful about the Lords of Pazluvoor and also my Young Uncle Madurandaka. I do not wish them to know even who you are! They should definitely not know why you are going!\"The Crown Prince of the Choz la Empire and the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Armies, Prince Aditya Karikala had told him all this. The Prince had repeatedly advised Vandiya Devan about how he should behave. Since he recalled all this, Vandiya Devan suppressed his desire to meet L ord Pazluvoor. He whipped his horse to move on quickly. In spite of the prodding, his tired horse merely plodded ahead. Having decided to spend the night at the Kadamboor fortress of the noble Sambuvaraya, he resolved to procure a better horse before resuming his journey the next morning.Ponniyin Selvan'"

wide east to west.', 'Time has twisted its name: for these days the reservoir is known as Veeraanatthu Lake.', 'In the windy months of Aadi -Aavani (August), when new floods fill the reservoir to almost overflow, anyone who looks at the Veera Narayana lake  will surely recall with pride and astonishment the splendid deeds of our ancestors in Tamil Nadu.', 'Did those ancients do things merely for the welfare of themselves and the people of their own times?', '...', 'They fulfilled tasks that would benefit thousands offuture generations in their sacred motherland.', 'On the 18th day of the month of Aadi, in the early hours of the evening, a young warrior, mounted on a horse, was riding down the banks of this ocean -like Veera Narayana Lake.', 'He belonged to the Vaanar clan  which is famous in the history of the gallant Tamils.', 'Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan was his name.', 'Having travelled a long distance and being worn and weary, his horse was walking along rather slowly.', 'The young cavalier did not seem concerned about this.', 'Th e sprawling reservoir had so enchanted his heart!It was common for rivers of the Chozla Kingdom to run with flood waters touching both banks during the Aadi month festival of Padhinettam Perukku.', 'The lakes fed by these rivers would also be filled to capa city, with waves jostling and colliding upon their embankments.', 'Waters from the river called North Cauvery by the devout, but commonly known as Kollidam, rushed into the Veera Narayana Lake, through the Vadavaru stream and made it a turbulent sea.Seventy four floodgates on the lake distributed the bounty via aqueducts to distant tracts of the country side.', 'With these irrigation waters from the lake, activities such as ploughing, sowing and seed transplanting were being carried out as far as the eye could see.Here and there, the song of farmers who were ploughing and women who were transplanting created a pleasant and joyous music.', 'Listening to all this, Vandiya Devan was riding quite slowly, without prodding his tired horse.', 'As soon as he had climbed the  embankment, he had started counting the floodgates with the intention of finding out if popular claims, which declared the lake to have seventy -four floodgates, were true!', 'After having come about one and a half leagues along the bank, he had counted seven ty gates.Aha!', 'How huge is this lake?', 'How wide and how long?', 'Can we not say that the tanks built by the great Pallava monarchs in the Thondai Kingdom are mere ponds and pools compared with this immense reservoir?', 'Did not Prince Raja-aditya son of King Paranthaka who conquered Madurai, think of building this great tank to conserve the waters of the North Cauvery which were going wastefully into the sea?', 'And did he not execute his thinking into action?', 'How great a genius he must have been!', 'Who can we compare to his brave nobility!', 'During the battle at Takkolam, did he not, riding an elephant go to the forefront and single handed, enter combat?', 'And in the course of that confrontation did he not receive enemy spears on his chest and give up his very life?', 'And b ecause of it did he not get the title Deva who reposed atop the elephant as he departed for the heavens meant for the brave?', 'These kings of the Chozla Dynasty are remarkable!', 'They were just as just as they were brave!', 'And as in justice they excelled in the veneration of their Gods.', \"Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan's shoulders swelled with pride when he thought of his good fortune in having received the friendship of a Chozla prince of such a dynasty.\", 'Just like the waves that dashed against the banks of the lake because of the swift western breeze, his heart too bubbled with gratification and pride.', 'Thinking all such thoughts Vandiya Devan reached the southern end of Veera Narayana Lake.', 'There he could view the panorama of the Vadavaru stream separating from the North Cauvery and falling into the lake.', 'For a short distance inside the embankment, the lake shore was silted forming a sandy beach.', 'A number of casuarina trees and wood -apple trees had been planted on the beach so that rising flood waters would not des troy the embankment.', \"Nanal reeds had grown thickly along the water's edge.\", 'From a distance, the scenic view of the rushing waters from the tree lined North River merging into the lake in the south -west, seemed like a colorful, newly created painting.', 'Vandi ya Devan saw a few other things that increased the pleasing joyousness of this enchanting scene.', 'Was it not the day of the Aadi Festival?', 'Crowds of people from nearby villages, dragging their carts covered with canopies of sandal -colored, supple coconut-leaves, were coming there.', 'Men, women, children and even several elderly folks all wearing new clothes and vividly dressed in various ways had come.', 'Bunches of fragrant flowers, such as the hearts of country cactus, chrysanthemum, jasmine, gardenia, champaka  and iruvatchi decorated the braids of women.', 'Several had come with families bringing stewed rice and fancy picnic foods.', \"Some stood by the water's edge and ate their picnic rice-dishes from platters of plantain -flower petals.\", 'Others, more brave, had ven tured further into the water to cross over to the bank of the Vadavaru.', 'Some children threw the platters from which they had eaten into the floodgates and clapped their hands with laughter to see the petals float through the gates to be rushed onto the canals.', 'Some mischievous young men plucked the flowers off the heads of their loved ones and threw them into the water, merely to see them being cast upon the shore.', 'Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan stood there watching all this for a while.', 'He listened with an e ager ear when some of the girls with pleasant voices sang.', 'They sang traditional boat-songs and flood-songs as well as folk songs like Kummi and Sindhu.Come, oh ye young maidens,  Look at the North river bubbling by!Come watch, oh ye friends, Look at the White river rushing by!Come, oh come all ye girls, To look at the Cauvery tumbling by!Such flood-songs pleasingly flooded the ears of Vandiya Devan.', 'Others sang ballads about the bravery and fame of Chozla kings.', 'Some girls sang of Vijayala Chozl a who had fought in thirty-two battles and had worn his ninety -six body wounds like ornaments.', 'Others sang acclaiming the bravery of his son, Aditya Chozla, and how he constructed sixty-four Shiva temples all along the Cauvery - from where it rose till it mingled into the sea.', \"One girl sang the fame of King Aditya's son, Paranthaka Chozla, who had not only conquered the Pandiya, Pallava and Chera kings but had also sent an army to Lanka to hoist his victory flag.\", 'When each girl sang, several people stood ar ound her listening with rapt attention.', 'They applauded with loud shouts of \"Ah, ah\" and expressed their happiness!An elderly woman noticed Vandiya Devan who was sitting on his horse and listening to all this.', '\"Thambi!', 'You seem to have come from a long di stance; you are tired!', 'Come down from your horse to eat this stewed rice,\" she said.Immediately several young girls noticed our youthful traveller.', 'They whispered amongst themselves about his appearance and laughed merrily.', 'Vandiya Devan was overcome by a certain mortification on one side and delight on the other.', 'For a moment he considered dismounting and eating the food offered by the old woman.', 'If he did so, the young maids would surely gather around to tease and laugh.', 'So what?', 'Is it easy to behold so many beautiful maidens in one place?', 'Even their laughter and teasing would be heavenly music.', \"In Vandiya Devan's eyes all those girls on the lake shore appeared like the heavenly nymphs Ramba and Menaka!At the same time he noticed something towards th e south-west along the flow of River Vadavaru and hesitated.\", 'About seven or eight large boats with white, spreading sails filled with the breeze were coming swiftly like white swans floating with wide -spread wings.', 'All the people engaged in various merri ments turned to avidly look in the direction from which the boats were coming.', 'One of the boats came forward more swiftly and reached the lake shore where the embankment turned west.', 'Several well-built footmen carrying sharp & shiny spears were in that boat.', 'Some of them jumped on to the lake shore and started shoving the people with shouts of \"Go!', 'Move!\"', 'Before being pushed around too much, the people picked up their containers and belongings and quickly started climbing upon the bank.', 'Vandiya Devan could not understand any of this.', 'Who were these men?', 'Who were coming in the sailboats behind them?', 'Where were they coming from?', 'Perhaps they belonged to the royal household?Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan approached an elderly man leaning upon his cane by the bank .', '\"Sir, whose men are these?', 'And whose boats are those coming behind like a school of swans?', 'Why are these footmen chasing away the people?', 'And why are the people hurrying away?\"', 'came his questions, one upon the other.\"Thambi!', 'Do you not know?', 'There is a  flag flying in the middle of those sailboats.', 'See what is embossed on it!\"', 'said the elder.', '\"Seems like a palm tree.', '\"\"It is a palm tree!', \"Don't you know that the palmtree -flag belongs to the Lord of Pazluvoor?\", '\"\"Is it the great warrior, Lord Pazluvoor, who is coming?\"', 'asked Vandiya Devan in a startled voice.', '\"It must be so.', 'Who else could raise the palmtree -flag and come?\"', \"said the elderly man.Vandiya Devan's eyes opened wide with immeasurable surprise as he looked towards the boats.\", 'Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan had heard much about Lord Pazluvoor.', 'But, who would not have heard about them?', 'The names of the brothers - The Elder Lord Pazluvoor and The Younger Lord Pazluvoor -- were renowned from Lanka in the south to the Kalinga Kingdom in the north.', 'Pazlu voor, situated on the northern banks of the Cauvery near the city of Uraiyoor was their capital.', 'Even from the times of Vijayala Chozla, the Pazluvoor Family had won heroic fame.', 'They had a lot of give and take with the royal family of the Chozlas.', 'Because  of this and also because of their nobility, bravery and fame the Pazluvoor clan had all the distinguishing characters of a royal family.', 'They also had the right to carry their own pennant.The elder of the present Lords of Pazluvoor had fought in twenty-four campaigns.', 'During his times he had won acclaim as having no equal in war in the Chozla Kingdom.', 'Since he had now crossed the age of fifty, he no longer entered the battlefield directly.', 'Nevertheless, he now held several eminent positions in the gover nment of the Chozlas.', 'In the Chozla Empire, he was the head of finance; head of food supply.', 'He had the authority to levy taxes according to political needs.', 'He had the right to call upon any princeling, nobleman or squire and order them thus: \"This year you shall pay this much tribute\" and the powers to implement such orders.', \"Therefore, next to Emperor Sundara Chozla he was the most powerful man in the Chozla Kingdom.Vandiya Devan's heart brimmed with an eagerness to meet this powerful, illustrious and noble Lord of Pazluvoor.\", 'At the same time he recalled the words uttered in privacy by Prince Aditya Karikala, at the new Golden Palace in Kanchi City.', '\"Vandiya Deva, I know you to be a brave man.', 'At the same time I trust you to be intelligent and give you  this immense responsibility.', 'Of the two letters I have given you, deliver one to my father the Emperor and the other to my sister the Younger Pirati.', '(Pirati is the term used to refer to princesses of the ruling house.)', 'I hear all sorts of rumors about even the senior officials of the kingdom in Tanjore.', 'Therefore, the contents of my letters should not become known to anyone.', 'Even the most eminent persons should not realize that you are carrying letters from me.', 'Do not get into quarrels with anyone on the  way.', 'You should not merely avoid conflicts of your seeking; but also not be involved in disputes thrust upon you.', 'I very well know about your courage.', 'You have proved it several times.', 'Therefore, there shall be no loss of valor in escaping from duels forced upon you.', 'Most important, you should be particularly careful about the Lords of Pazluvoor and also my Young Uncle Madurandaka.', 'I do not wish them to know even who you are!', 'They should definitely not know why you are going!', '\"The Crown Prince of the Choz la Empire and the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Armies, Prince Aditya Karikala had told him all this.', 'The Prince had repeatedly advised Vandiya Devan about how he should behave.', 'Since he recalled all this, Vandiya Devan suppressed his desire to meet L ord Pazluvoor.', 'He whipped his horse to move on quickly.', 'In spite of the prodding, his tired horse merely plodded ahead.', 'Having decided to spend the night at the Kadamboor fortress of the noble Sambuvaraya, he resolved to procure a better horse before resuming his journey the next morning.Ponniyin Selvan']\n"

      "sixty-four Shiva temples all along the Cauvery - from \n",
      "where it rose till it mingled into the sea. One girl sang the \n",

      "not only conquered the Pandiya, Pallava and Chera kings \n",
      "but had also sent an army to Lanka to hoist his victory flag. \n",

      "west along the flow of River Vadavaru and hesitated. \n",
      "About seven or eight large boats with white, spreading \n",

      "All the people engaged in various merri ments turned to \n",
      "avidly look in the direction from which the boats were \n",

      "started climbing upon the bank. Vandiya Devan could not \n",
      "understand any of this. Who were these men? Who were \n",

      "coming from? Perhaps they belonged to the royal \n",

      "Vandiya Devan felt that he must stop this absurd rumpus.\n",
      "He came forward and said, \"Sirs why are you arguing? Do \n",
      "you have nothing better to do? If you itch for a fight, why \n",
      "not go to Lanka? There is a big war going on there.\"\n",
      "Saying, \"Who is this fellow trying to make peace?\" Nambi \n",

      "\"I will tell the facts I know. There seems to be no quarrel \n",

      "\"How can you say that? Where is the proof that Shiva and \n",

      "\"Young man! Are you mocking me?\" roared Azlvar -\n",

      "\"Yes, Thambi yes. Tell us more!\" applauded the crowd.\n",
      "\"Upon measuring them, I found both to be of exactly the \n",

      "and Shiva are one and the same. Those who don't know \n",
      "this should have their mouths filled with dirt!' Saying it \n",
      "they gave me this fistful of dirt to throw in the mouths of \n",
      "the idiots who quarrel about it.\" Vandiya Devan opened his \n",
      "fist to show a handful of dirt. He then threw it among \n",
      "them. Upon this all hell broke loose. The men in the exited \n",
      "crowd started picking up dirt and rubble and began \n",
      "throwing it at each other. Azlvar -adiyan also entered the \n",
      "fracas with shouts of \"Idiots! Unbeli evers!\" and used his \n",
      "staff. A great disturbance and commotion was about to \n",
      "erupt. Luckily, a stentorian announcement thwarting all \n",
      "this, was heard nearby.\"Best of warriors, bravest of the brave, he who destroyed \n",

      "made the announcement.\n",
      "The heralds who made these announcements came first. \n",
      "Then came the drummers. Behind them came men carrying \n",
      "the palmtree-flag. Next marched several smart footmen \n",
      "bearing lances and spears. Behind all these men came a \n",
      "dark, well-built man seated on a finely decorated elephant. \n",
      "The sight of the warrior on the elephant looked like a dark \n",
      "cloud resting atop a mountain peak. People stood on both \n",
      "sides of the roadway and watched. Vandiya Devan guessed \n",
      "that the man seated on the elephant was Lord Pazluvoor.\n",
      "Behind the elephant came a palanquin with silken drapes \n",
      "pulled close. Before he could wonder who could be inside, \n",
      "Vallavarayan saw a fair hand full of bracelets and bangles \n",
      "come out and slightly part t he curtains.  The dazzling face \n",
      "of a girl could be seen inside the palanquin: like the moon \n",
      "shining forth from behind a shifting cloud cover.\n",
      "Though he was a connoisseur of the beauty of womankind, \n",
      "though her captivating face seemed like the radiating ful l \n",
      "moon, for some reason, Vandiya Devan was not happy to \n",
      "see that face. An irrational fear and disgust took hold of \n",
      "him. At the same time the woman's eyes focussed on \n",
      "something near Vandiya Devan.  The next instant the \n",
      "horrified sound of a girl's scream was  heard.  The screens \n",
      "pulled shut once again!\n",
      "Vallavarayan looked around him. His intuition said that the \n",
      "lady had screamed upon sighting something nearby. He \n",
      "searched around again. Azlvar -adiyan was leaning back on \n",
      "a tamarind tree just behind him. He saw that the fanatic \n",
      "Vaishnava's face had turned undescribably horrible and \n",
      "ugly. His heart filled with irrational surprise and revolt. \n",

      "\"Hey! This is a troublesome horse. It will not let me \n",

      "\"Well, I have an invitation of sorts. Kandamaran, the son \n",

      "\"I was about to ask you the same question. why are you \n",
      "following me? Why don't you go your own way?\"\n",
      "\"Well it is because of not knowing which way to go. \n",
      "Where are you going? Perhaps to Kadamboor?\"\n",

      "perumal.\"\n",
      "\"I thought that you would perhaps not come to a Vishnu \n",

      "they had reached the Vinnagara temple.\n",
      "Paranthaka Chozla I, a grandson of Vijayala Chozla, had \n",

      "also had the honored name of Veera Narayana.\n",
      "During Paranthaka's times, the Rashtrakutas in the north \n",
      "were powerful monarchs. He expected them to come from \n",
      "Manyaketa (roughly present day Maharashtra) and invade \n",
      "the territories of the Tamils. Therefore he stationed a huge \n",
      "army, led by his eldest son Prince Raja -aditya, in the \n",
      "Thirumunaipadi Territories north of the Cauvery.\n",
      "Prince Raja-aditya had a brilliant idea while his large \n",
      "numbers of soldiers waited in idleness, with nothing to do. \n",
      "Using them he wished to fulfil a major undertaking for the \n",
      "benefit of the population. Enormous quantities of flood \n",
      "waters flowing in the Kollidam river were going \n",
      "wastefully into the sea. Wishing to make use of these \n",
      "waters, he made his soldiers build a huge, spreading \n",
      "reservoir. In honor of his distinguished father he named it \n",
      "the Veera Narayana Lake. He then established the town of \n",
      "Veera-narayana-puram on its shores and also built a \n",

      "sublime meditation? Therefore, it was customary in those \n",
      "days to build Vinnagaras on lake shores so that the deity \n",

      "When Azlvar-adiyan sang these songs, tears overflowed \n",
      "from his eyes and streamed down his cheeks. Vandiya \n",
      "Devan listened attentively. Though tears did not stream \n",
      "from his eyes, he was very moved. His biased opinions \n",
      "about Azlvar-adiyan were somewhat tr ansformed. This \n",
      "fellow is very devout, he thought.\n",
      "Several others listened to the songs with interest. The \n",

      "you know them all?\"\n",

      "\"I entreat you to teach this child all the songs you know,\" \n",
      "requested the priest.\n",

      "boy with the childish face shining with  devotion would \n",
      "grow up to be known as Nadamuni Adigal the foremost of \n",

      "all thousand poems; set them to music; sing them and \n",
      "along with his disciples popularize those songs all over the \n",
      "country. Alavandar who would be born as the grandson of \n",

      "thirty, fifty or even more -- surrounded Vandiya Devan \n",

      "\"Good reply. Intelligent fellow\" muttered Lord Pazluvoor.\n",

      "has brought her here in a covered palanquin. Apparently he \n",

      "sending her to the inner apartments in the palace. One of \n",
      "the maids who saw the girl by peeping in through the \n",
      "window, came and described her beauty. That is the cause \n",
      "for the laughter.  They were discussing if she was a \n",
      "Singhala girl, a Kalinga lady or perhaps a maid from \n",
      "Chera. You know that the ancestors of the Pazluvoor clan \n",
      "originally came here from the Chera country?\"\n",

      "Pazluvoor married this mysterious beauty?\"\n",
      "\"It must be less than two years. He has not left her alone \n",
      "for even a short while from the time he married her! He \n",
      "takes his ladylove along wherever he goes;  in a closed \n",
      "palanquin! In fact there has been a lot of sniggering about \n",
      "it all over the country. Vandiya Deva, won't there be \n",

      "involved in such entanglements with women?\"\n",
      "\"I do not think that is the reason. Kandamara, shall I tell \n",
      "you the real reason for the laughter? Generally women are \n",
      "envious. Don't think I am belittling the women in your \n",
      "family. All womankind is like that! The women of your \n",
      "household are dark-colored beauties. However, Lord \n",
      "Pazluvoor's beloved is rosily -fair and golden hued. That is \n",

      "stories about her...!\"\n",
      "\"Hey! What is this wonder? How do you know about her \n",

      "not yours!\"\n",
      "\"Kandamara, I am not afraid of all that. You know it. \n",
      "Moreover, I have not done anything improper. I was \n",

      "Lord Pazluvoor and his retinue went past. The  elephant, \n",

      "true?\"\n",
      "\"Yes we had sent all those accolades. So what ...?\"\n",
      "\"So what? Nothing. I was just comparing the reception that \n",
      "you accorded to Lord Pazluvoor and the welcome given to \n",
      "me; nothing else ...\"\n",
      "Kandamaran laughed lightly, \"We gave him the tribute and \n",
      "honor due to the official who levies taxes. A welcome \n",
      "appropriate to a great warrior was given to you! Sometime, \n",
      "with God Muruga's grace, when you become the son -in-\n",
      "law to our house we shall give you the honors due to a \n",

      "\"Lord Pazluvoor was coming seated on the dark, huge \n",

      "him, a covered palanquin followed him. Even as I \n",
      "wondered about who could come in a covered palanquin, a \n",
      "hand from inside parted the curtains. I could barely see the \n",
      "face within. The hand and face were golden -hued. That \n",
      "was all I saw. From what you said just now, I realize that \n",
      "she must be the beloved of Lord Pazluvoor.\"\n",
      "\"Vandiya Deva, you are a lucky fellow! It is being said \n",
      "that no man has glimpsed upon that Young -Queen of \n",
      "Pazluvoor. You could at least see her hand and face for a \n",
      "second. From what you saw, can you guess anything about \n",
      "the nation which gave birth to that beauty?\" asked \n",
      "Kandamaran.\n",
      "\"I did not ponder about it at that time. Now that I think of \n",

      "sea like Java, Kadaram (Malaya), Yavana (Greece -Rome). \n",

      "At that moment, the sound of musical instruments could be \n",
      "heard somewhere nearby. Several kinds of drums, flutes, \n",
      "pipes and instruments like salli, karadi, parai, udukku  \n",
      "were being tuned together. \"What is that noise?\" asked \n",
      "Vallavarayan.\n",
      "\"The Kuravai Koothu (gypsy dance) is about to begin. The \n",

      "eat early and sleep well?\" \n",
      "Vandiya Devan recalled Azlvar -adiyan mentioning the \n",

      "When they walked ahead a little and turned, they could see \n",
      "the stage being set for the dancers. The guests were \n",
      "gathering in front of the stage. The stage for the gypsy \n",
      "dance was set in a wide courtyard spread with clean -white \n",
      "sand and situated in a spot surrounded by the palace walls \n",
      "and the towering battlements of the fort. The stage was \n",
      "decorated with colorful drawings of cocks, peacocks, \n",
      "swans and parrots. They had further decked the  stage with \n",
      "several fragrant flower garlands, red -rice popped white, \n",
      "colored millet, yellow turmeric and other powders, \n",
      "kunrimani (small red berry -beads), and other vivid \n",
      "decorations.  Tall oil-lamps and flaming torches tried to \n",
      "drive the darkness away. Bu t the swirling fragrance from 4smoldering frankincense and smokey torches created a \n",
      "misty screen dimming the lights.  The musicians sat on \n",
      "both sides and in front of the stage and played their \n",
      "instruments with gusto. The fragrant flowers, sweet \n",
      "smelling incense and the drum beats all together made \n",
      "Vandiya Devan feel light -headed.\n",
      "After all the important guests were seated, the nine \n",
      "maidens who were to perform the gypsy dance came on \n",
      "the stage. They wore the tight fitting clothes and \n",
      "ornaments suitable for d ancing; they had bell-filled anklets \n",
      "on their feet; brilliant red hued flowers of the hill country, \n",
      "flowers favored by the God Muruga, decorated their \n",
      "hairstyles. A long garland woven with such flowers thrown \n",
      "upon their shoulders, seemed to bind them to ea ch other as \n",
      "they stood upon the stage. In their hands they daintily \n",
      "grasped beautiful parrots made of sandalwood painted a \n",
      "vivid green.\n",
      "After greeting the audience they began to sing and dance. \n",
      "They first sang a few verses in praise of God Muruga. \n",
      "They sang of the brave deeds of Muruga; and they sang of \n",
      "his victorious spear which killed the demons Soora -padma \n",
      "and Gaja-mukha and then dried up the vast ocean. They \n",
      "sang of how he chose for his bride, a maid from the Tamil \n",
      "country, a gypsy maid from the hills who was guarding the \n",
      "millet fields, even as heavenly nymphs offered prayers to \n",
      "marry the young warrior -God. Their song celebrated the \n",
      "grace and benevolence of Velan, i.e., Murugan who bears \n",
      "the spear. The lyrical songs, the fast paced dance, the quick \n",
      "drum-beats, enchanting flute all in combination bewitched \n",
      "those who were watching. With the following words of \n",
      "prayer the dance concluded:\n",
      "Let hunger and disease be destroyed;Let enmity be routed;Let rain and fertility increase;Let bounty grow boundless.\n",
      "The maidens stepped off the stage and moved away.\n",
      "Next, a man and woman dressed as oracles -- thevar-aalan \n",
      "and thevar-aati,  came on stage. The divine -man and \n",
      "divine-woman wore blood-red clothes. They had brilliant \n",
      "garlands made of blood -red oleander flowers. They had \n",
      "painted their foreheads with bright red kumkum powders. \n",
      "Even their lips seemed blood -red because they had chewed \n",
      "the betel leaf and areca -nut. Their eyes seemed blood -shot! \n",
      "The Velan Attam or oracle dance, began calmly enough. \n",
      "They danced by themselves and with arms linked together. \n",
      "As time passed the tempo and passion increased. The \n",
      "divine-woman picked up a spear from the side. The man \n",
      "tried to pry it from her hands; and she would not let go. \n",
      "The dance became more frenzied: finally the man leaped \n",
      "across the resonating stage, jumping high, he plucked the \n",
      "spear from his companion. With an expression of fear on \n",
      "her face she moved away behind the screens.\n",
      "The divine-man now danced all by himself with more and \n",
      "more rapid movements. He acted the part of the God Velan killing the demon Soora. Soora's head was chopped off \n",
      "repeatedly. But the severed -head grew back again and \n",
      "again. Velan grew angrier and angrier as the head came \n",

      "\"What sacrifice?\" asked the priest.\n",

      "\"Yes, we will offer it. We shall surely offer the sacrifice.\"\n",

      "of the fortress, he saw a head! \n",

      "blinked his eyelids to look again: the head was no longer \n",
      "there! He felt ashamed about the worthless fear that had 5taken hold of him. Several other emotions beyond his \n",

      "6    Midnight Meeting\n",
      "After the gypsy dance and the oracle dance, there was a \n",
      "lavish feast for the guests. Vallavarayan Vandiya Devan \n",
      "could not enjoy the banquet. His body was tired an d his \n",
      "mind was agitated. His friend Kandamaran, seated next to \n",
      "him, pointed out the several dignitaries with pride.\n",
      "Besides Lord Pazluvoor and Lord Sambuvaraya, there was \n",
      "Thennavan Mazlava-raya Lord of Mazlapadi Mazluvoor; \n",
      "The Elder and largest land -holder of Kunratoor had come; \n",
      "then there was triple-crowned Pallava-raya. The Lords \n",
      "Thanthongi Kalinga-raya, Vanangamudi Munai -raya, \n",
      "Deva-senapati Poova-raya; that fearless lion, Lord Muthu -\n",
      "raya, double-canopied Raajali, and the chief land -holder of \n",
      "Kolli Hills-- all these men were there at the banquet. \n",
      "Kandamaran whispered their names into Vandiya Devan's \n",
      "ears and pointed them out discretely.\n",
      "These dignitaries were not ordinary men; nor was it \n",
      "common to see them all assembled together in one place \n",
      "like this. Each of them was a territorial chieftain; or they \n",
      "had earned the distinction of territorial chieftains because \n",
      "of their bravery. In those days, the title araya or raya which \n",
      "was derived from the sanskrit word raja or Tamil word \n",
      "arasa (meaning king) denoted  nobility or royalty. \n",
      "Territorial chieftains and noblemen of equal rank were \n",
      "entitled to add the suffix rayan or arayan to their names. \n",
      "They were also called by the name of their town with the \n",
      "added title. (In fact our hero Vandiya Devan bore the name \n",
      "Vallava-rayan because he was born in the noble family of \n",
      "Vallam.)\n",
      "But, these chieftains did not bear their titles merely \n",
      "because of their noble birth and thereby enjoy the comforts \n",
      "and indulgence of palace life. Only those men who were \n",
      "able-bodied and brave enough to enter the battle -field \n",
      "could safeguard their titles and territories. Therefore, each \n",
      "of these men had not only participated in several \n",
      "campaigns but they also bore the wounds of such warfare \n",
      "on their bodies. Now, all these men governed their \n",
      "territories or kingdoms under the suzerainty of Emperor \n",
      "Sundara Chozla of Pazlayarai. Many of them were \n",
      "important officials of the Chozla government.\n",
      "Normally, Vandiya Devan would have felt immense \n",
      "elation at having seen all these noblemen in the same \n",
      "place. However, he felt no joy about it. Why have all these \n",
      "men gathered together here? The question occurred to him \n",
      "again and again. All sorts of garbled doubts filled his \n",
      "mind. With his mind filled with such confusion, he sought his \n",
      "bed in the isolated spot re adied by Kandamaran for him. \n",
      "Because the palace was hosting several important \n",
      "dignitaries, a tiny, covered terrace was allotted to him as a \n",
      "bed-chamber. \n",
      "\"You seem to be very tired. Lie down and sleep well. I will \n",
      "take care of the other guests and later c ome to sleep in this \n",
      "terrace itself,\" said Kandamaran before going away.\n",
      "As soon as he lay down, sleep swirled into Vandiya \n",
      "Devan's eyes. Nitra Devi, the Goddess of Sleep took hold \n",
      "of him completely. But what use? There is Mind which \n",
      "cannot be conquered even by the Goddess of Sleep! Even \n",
      "though his body remained still and his eyes stayed tightly \n",
      "shut, thoughts buried deep in the mind blossomed into \n",
      "dreams. Several meaningless incidents, happenings beyond \n",
      "reason took place in that dream world. \n",
      "Somewhere in the distance a lone wolf howled. One wolf \n",
      "became ten wolves; hundred wolves; they all howled \n",
      "together. While howling they came nearer and nearer and \n",
      "nearer. In that pitch darkness their eyes burned like tiny \n",
      "embers. They came closer and closer. Vandiya D evan tried \n",
      "to turn around and run away to escape. But, on the other \n",
      "side there were tens, hundreds, no thousands of dogs --\n",
      "barking loudly, rushing towards him. The eyes of those \n",
      "hunting dogs glowed like embers. What will happen to me \n",
      "if I am caught in between these mad dogs and wolves? \n",
      "thought Vandiya Devan and shivered. \n",
      "Luckily there was a temple right in front. He ran into the \n",
      "temple and pulled the door shut, bolting it hurriedly. When \n",
      "he looked around it seemed to be a temple of the Mother \n",
      "Goddess. A statue of Kali stood there with a horrible face \n",
      "and tongue hanging out.  A priest rose from behind the \n",
      "statue. He held a terrible machete in his hands. \"Oh! You \n",
      "have come,\" he said as he came closer and closer.\n",
      "\"What is the history of your noble family? F or how many \n",
      "generations have your clansmen ruled their kingdom? Tell \n",
      "the truth!\" said the priest.\n",
      "\"The Vallava Rayas of the Vaanar family had ruled for \n",
      "three hundred years. During my father's times we lost all \n",
      "our lands to the Vaithumba kings,\" replied Va ndiya Devan. \n",
      "\"Then you are not the right sacrifice. Run away,\" said the \n",
      "priest with disgust. \n",
      "Suddenly Kali turned into a statue of Krishna! Two \n",
      "delightful maidens came in, singing the psalms of Saint \n",
      "Andal and danced with abandon in front of the statue. \n",
      "While he was enchanted with these sights, he heard the \n",
      "song \"We saw, we saw, we saw things pleasing to the eye,\" \n",
      "behind him. Turning around he saw Azlvar -adiyan Nambi. \n",
      "Yes it was him singing. Oh no. Not him; it was just his \n",
      "head that sang. The severed head  was placed on the \n",
      "sacrificial alter! 6Unable to bear this sight, Vandiya Devan turned away. \n",
      "Upon turning, he banged his head upon the pillar. The \n",
      "dream melted away. Eyes opened. But he saw a sight that \n",
      "seemed to mix reality with dreams.\n",
      "In a spot directly in front of his terrace, he could see the \n",
      "fortress walls of Kadamboor palace; he could see a head \n",
      "on top of these walls. It was the head of that very same \n",
      "Azlvar-adiyan Nambi. This time he realized that it was \n",
      "neither a dream nor a hallucination. Becaus e, however \n",
      "long he stared at it, the head remained there. It was not \n",
      "merely a head, there was a body behind it. He could easily \n",
      "detect both hands of Azlvar -adiyan holding on to the wall. \n",
      "In addition, the fellow was staring rather intensely at \n",
      "something below, inside the wall. \n",
      "What is he looking at so earnestly, inside there? ... There is \n",
      "some kind of deception and intrigue in this. Azlvar -adiyan \n",
      "could not have come here with good intentions. He must \n",
      "have come here with vile plans to perform some evil deed . \n",
      "Is it not my duty, being Kandamaran's dearest friend, to \n",
      "stop this wickedness? How can I sleep in idleness without \n",
      "guarding the house of these folks who have fed and housed \n",
      "me tonight? Vallavarayan jumped up. He picked up a knife \n",
      "in its sheath lying on h is side and stuck it in his waist -\n",
      "band. He walked towards the direction in which he saw \n",
      "Nambi's head.\n",
      "Remember, he was sleeping in a corner of the upper \n",
      "terrace? From there as he walked towards the outer walls \n",
      "of the palace, he had to go around several tu rrets, pillars \n",
      "and decorative rooftops. After walking on for a while he \n",
      "suddenly heard the sound of voices talking somewhere \n",
      "nearby. He hesitated. Hiding himself behind a pillar he \n",
      "peeped down below. \n",
      "In a narrow courtyard enclosed by tall walls he saw ab out \n",
      "ten or twelve men seated comfortably. The towering walls \n",
      "hid the rising moonlight. However, an iron oil -lamp buried \n",
      "in the wall gave some light. All the men seated there were \n",
      "the dignitaries he had met at the banquet earlier; the \n",
      "chieftains and elder officials of the Chozla Empire. \n",
      "They must have gathered in this midnight conference to \n",
      "discuss some important matter. Azlvar -adiyan must be \n",
      "trying to spy upon what they were saying and doing, by \n",
      "hanging on the outer walls. There is no doubt about the \n",
      "fact that Azlvar-adiyan is a very shrewd and clever fellow. \n",
      "From where he was positioned on the wall, Azlvar -adiyan \n",
      "could more or less see all the men seated in conference \n",
      "below. He could hear their talk very well. But the men \n",
      "seated there  could not see Azlva r-adiyan. The courtyard \n",
      "and palace wall were situated in that fashion! Somehow, \n",
      "the fellow had chanced upon such a perfect spot. \n",
      "Capable fellow. No doubt!  But all his cleverness will not \n",
      "work with this Vandiya Devan of the Vaanar clan. \n",
      "Somehow, I must get hold of that masquerading Vaishnava \n",
      "fanatic .... but if I am to catch him, I cannot do so without \n",
      "attracting the attention of the men assembled below. I have to cross the courtyard before I can reach those walls. There \n",
      "may be some danger in crossing the  courtyard in full view \n",
      "of those men.\n",
      "He recalled the words of Sambuvaraya saying \"He need \n",
      "not have come here, today of all days.\" \n",
      "These men are gathered here to discuss something \n",
      "important. It is clear that they do not want anyone to know \n",
      "what their discussions are about. In such a situation if they \n",
      "suddenly see me, they will start suspecting me. By the time \n",
      "I explain about Azlvar-adiyan he would have jumped off \n",
      "the wall and escaped. All that will remain is the doubt \n",
      "about me. If they ask, \"Why did you,  who were supposed \n",
      "to be sleeping, come here?\" what can I reply? I will \n",
      "definitely put Kandamaran in a delicate position. There! \n",
      "Even Kandamaran is part of this meeting; he is seated at \n",
      "the back. If I ask him in the morning I can know all.\n",
      "As these thoughts ran through his mind, Vandiya Devan \n",
      "saw a covered palanquin resting in one corner of the \n",
      "courtyard below him. Is this not the same palanquin that \n",
      "came behind Lord Pazluvoor and his elephant?  That lady \n",
      "who was in it, who parted the curtains to peep outs ide, I \n",
      "wonder where she is now. I believe the old man did not \n",
      "even send her to the women's apartments. This is the \n",
      "predicament if somewhat older men marry very young \n",
      "girls. Suspicion drains their very life. They cannot bear to \n",
      "be parted from their young wi ves even for one moment! \n",
      "Perhaps even now, Pazluvoor's Young -Queen is in this \n",
      "palanquin! Gosh! Look at the fate of this great warrior! At \n",
      "this age, he is enslaved by a slip of a girl and is on tender -\n",
      "hooks. She is not all that great a Rathi, Menaka or Ramb a \n",
      "(heavenly beauties). \n",
      "No, Vandiya Devan had not forgotten the feeling of \n",
      "distaste which he experienced when he had seen her by the \n",
      "roadside. I wonder what this brave Lord Pazluvoor sees in \n",
      "her?  More surprising is this Azlvar -adiyan's madness. \n",
      "Maybe he is waiting on that wall because this palanquin is \n",
      "here. What is the relationship between him and her? How \n",
      "can I know?  Perhaps she is his sister; or maybe his \n",
      "sweetheart. Maybe Lord Pazluvoor forcefully abducted \n",
      "her. He is capable of doing such things. May be this fellow \n",
      "is wandering around trying to find an opportunity to meet \n",
      "her and talk to her. Why should I bother about all this. Let \n",
      "me go back to sleep, thought Vandiya Devan.\n",
      "Just as he made this decision he heard his name being \n",
      "uttered down below. Imm ediately he began to listen with \n",
      "some interest.\n",
      "\"That fellow who came in saying that he was a friend of \n",
      "your son? Where is he sleeping? He should not hear \n",
      "anything that we utter here. Remember that he serves the \n",
      "Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Armies. Till all our \n",
      "plans are complete and the time for action arrives, no one \n",
      "should know about our plans. Even if there is the slightest \n",
      "suspicion that this fellow knows something, he must not be 7let outside this fortress. In fact it would be better to put a \n",
      "complete end to his activities ...\"\n",
      "Our readers can guess how Vandiya Devan felt upon \n",
      "hearing these words. But he did not move away from the \n",
      "spot. He made up his mind to listen to all their talk.\n",
      "Who was the Northern Commander -in-Chief? It was none \n",
      "other than the eldest son of Emperor Sundara Chozla. \n",
      "None other than the Crown Prince, next in line for the \n",
      "throne. Why should these fellows object to my serving that \n",
      "Prince? What is it that they are planning that must be kept \n",
      "secret from the Prince?'\n",
      "At that moment Kandamaran intervened for his friend: \n",
      "\"Vandiya Devan is sleeping peacefully in the corner \n",

      "will not interfere in things that do not concern him. Even if \n",
      "he hears something he will not hinder y our plans in any \n",
      "way. I will be responsible for that.\"\n",
      "\"I am happy that you trust him so much. But none of us \n",
      "know of him or his credentials. That is why I warned you. \n",
      "What we are going to discuss now is about the rights of \n",
      "succession to a large empire. E ven if one whisper gets out \n",

      "\"I request Lord Sambuvaraya to please remain patient.  Let \n",
      "Munai Raya express his reservations freely. It is better to \n",

      "fifth year. I certainly accept that. But, I never declared \n",
      "myself as a reincarnation of Lord Rama who vowed to \n",
      "have only one wife! I never said that I will wed only one \n",
      "maid. I love that girl; she returned my sentiment. \n",

      "he takes his Young-Queen along wherever he goes.\"\n",
      "A laugh was heard in their midst.\n",
      "Lord Sambuvaraya jumped up. \"Who laughed? Let him \n",

      "while drawing his sword from its scabbard.\n",

      "that I take her with me to visit several places. But it is \n",

      "opinion in matters of the state.  I have never done that.\"\n",
      "\"If so, I request Lord Pazluvoor to clear just one more \n",
      "doubt. Why has this palanquin, which should have stayed \n",

      "meeting? Is there someone inside the closed palanquin or \n",
      "not? If there is no one inside, how is it th at I heard \n",

      "bangles that I heard inside, a little while ago?\" \n",
      "When Munai Raya asked these questions, a curious silence \n",
      "prevailed amidst that gathering.  Since these doubts had \n",
      "occurred to most of them, none spoke against the words of \n",
      "Munai Raya. Lord Sambuvaraya was muttering something \n",
      "to himself. But nothing was said.\n",
      "Tearing the silence apart, in a distinct voice, Lord \n",

      "\"Let no one think that my reverence or loyalty to Lord \n",

      "meeting. Let Emperor Sundara Chozla Paranthaka live \n",
      "long in this world and rule this Chozla Empire for a long \n",
      "time. However, unfortunately, if something happens to \n",
      "him: if the words of the palace doctors' come true, if the omens forecast by the comet appearing in the sky come \n",
      "true -- we have to decide who is eligible to succeed to the \n",
      "Chozla throne.\"\n",
      "\"We request that you state your opinion on this matter. \n",
      "There is no one here who has anything to say against your \n",
      "views.\"\n",
      "\"That is not correct. Each one of you must think and then \n",
      "express an impartial opinion. Permit me to recall some old \n",
      "history to your memories.  Twenty -four years ago, King \n",
      "Gandara Aditya who was a great philosopher and devout \n",
      "soul, died unexpectedly. When he died, his son, \n",
      "Madurandaka, was a one year old child. The Queen -\n",
      "consort of Gandara Aditya, the Lady Sembiyan Madevi, \n",
      "announced to us, the wishes of the King: his younger \n",
      "brother Arinjaya was to accept the Chozla throne after \n",
      "him. Therefore, we crowned Prince Arinjaya as the Chozla \n",
      "monarch. However, fate did not decree that Arinjaya \n",
      "should sit on the throne for more than a year. When \n",
      "Arinjaya died,  his son, Paranth aka Sundara Chozla, was a \n",
      "youth of twenty-four. Considering the welfare of the \n",
      "nation, all of us -- the ministers, advisors, territorial \n",
      "chieftains the heads of all the clans and leaders of the cities \n",
      "and districts -- decided unanimously, and crowned Sunda ra \n",
      "Chozla. None of us had cause to regret this. Because, until \n",
      "two years ago, he ruled the nation with justice; he \n",
      "respected our wishes and opinions and ruled this country \n",
      "lawfully. Because of him the Chozla power grew to \n",
      "include all neighboring nations un der its sway. \n",
      "\"Now, the health of Sundara Chozla is cause for concern. \n",
      "In this situation, who is eligible to succeed the Emperor? \n",
      "Madurandaka, the cherished son of King Gandara Aditya, \n",
      "is now grown up; he has the intelligence, education, the \n",
      "character, the devotion to God, all the qualities of a person \n",
      "worthy of the throne. Sundara Chozla's son, Aditya \n",
      "Karikala, who is younger to him by one year, is stationed \n",
      "in Kanchi as a Commander -in-Chief. Who between these \n",
      "two has the right to succeed to the throne? What is the \n",
      "code of inheritance among the clans? What is the law? \n",
      "What is the ancient tradition of the Tamils? Is it justice if \n",
      "the elder brother's son, Madurandaka inherits the nation? \n",
      "Or, is it legal for the grand -son of the younger brother to \n",
      "succeed? Each of you must consider this and clearly state \n",
      "your decision.\"\n",
      "\"Madurandaka, the son of the elder brother Gandara \n",
      "Aditya has the right to succeed. That is legal, justice, \n",

      "\"I agree\", \"That is my opinion too,\" so rose se veral voices. \n",
      "\"Your convictions are mine. Madurandaka deserves the \n",
      "throne. However, is everyone here ready to support and \n",
      "further this belief? Are you all ready to sacrifice your lives, \n",
      "your wealth and very soul for this cause? This very minute, \n",
      "are you all ready to swear in the name of Goddess Durga \n",
      "and take an oath of allegiance?\"  When Lord Pazluvoor 1asked this question his voice had a certain harshness, not \n",
      "heard till then.\n",
      "Silence prevailed for some time.  Lord Sambuvaraya then \n",
      "said, \"We are ready to take such an oath of support.  \n",
      "Before that, we need one clarification. What are the \n",
      "feelings of Prince Madurandaka? Is he ready to accept the \n",
      "throne and rule this Empire? We have heard that the \n",
      "cherished son of Gandara Aditya has forsaken the \n",
      "pleasures of worldly life and is fully involved in the \n",
      "devotion and worship of God Shiva. Several persons have \n",
      "said that he has no interest in worldly kingdoms. We have \n",
      "also heard that his mother, the Elder Pirati Sembiyan \n",
      "Madevi is totally opposed to his ascending t he throne. We \n",
      "wish to know the truth about this from you.\"\n",
      "\"A good point and you raised it at the correct time. I must \n",
      "clarify this question. I should have explained earlier --\n",
      "forgive me for not doing so,\" with this long introduction \n",
      "Lord Pazluvoor spoke as follows: \"The whole nation \n",
      "knows that the Lady Sembiyan Madevi discouraged her \n",
      "only son from having any interest in affairs of the state and \n",
      "raised him as a Saiva ascetic. But, neither nation nor \n",
      "people know the reason behind such behavior.  The Elder \n",
      "Pirati feared that his very life would be in danger if her son \n",
      "Madurandaka had any wish to rule the empire ... \"\n",
      "\"Aha! Is that so!\"\n",
      "\"Yes! To any mother, the wish  that the son to whom she \n",
      "gave birth should stay well and alive is greater than a \n",
      "desire that he should sit upon the throne of the Kingdom. \n",
      "Young Prince Madurandaka, who considered the words of \n",
      "his mother as gospel, turned his mind in the path of \n",
      "devotion and asceticism. Nevertheless, for sometime, his \n",
      "mind has slowly undergone some transformatio n. `This \n",
      "Chozla Empire is mine; it is my duty to rule the nation!' \n",
      "such thoughts have taken root and grown in his heart. If he \n",
      "knows that all of you are ready to support his cause, he is \n",
      "ready to come forward at a suitable time and openly \n",
      "declare his intentions.\" \n",
      "\"What proof do we have for this?\"\n",
      "\"I will, without delay, produce proof that will satisfy all of \n",
      "you. If I furnish such proof, will each of you take an oath \n",
      "of allegiance to this cause?\"\n",
      "Several of the men said \"We will! We will!\"\n",
      "\"I hope no one has any other kind of reservation?\"\n",
      "\"No! None!\"\n",
      "\"Then, I shall show proof. I shall also clear the doubts \n",
      "raised by Lord Vananga -mudi Munai Raya.\" With this \n",
      "declaration, Lord Pazluvoor rose from his seat. Walking \n",
      "majestically, he neared the closed pala nquin. \"Prince! Please part the curtains and grace the outside with \n",
      "your appearance. Permit these brave warriors, who are \n",
      "ready to sacrifice their very life, wealth and soul for you, \n",
      "to gaze upon your face.\" Lord Pazluvoor spoke in a very \n",
      "deferential voice.\n",
      "Vandiya Devan, who was sitting behind the pillar on the \n",
      "upper terrace and listening to all these discussions with an \n",
      "overpowering curiosity, now peeped down carefully. As \n",
      "before, a hand parted the curtains of the palanquin. It too \n",
      "was a golden hand. It seemed to be the very same fair hand \n",
      "he had seen once before. But he now realized that he had \n",
      "surmised the golden bracelet worn by royalty to be a \n",

      "not know how to swim in a flowing river. Once, when he \n",
      "was in the army on border patrol along the banks of the \n",
      "North Pennar, he waded into the river for a bath. H e was \n",
      "caught in a swollen whirlpool. That sinister and devilish \n",

      "He had not even dreamed that a challenge would arise. Of \n",
      "course, he had heard of Madurandaka, the son of King \n",

      "was an ardent worshipper of God Shiva. But he had never \n",

      "thought about such things.\n",
      "What is the legality, the justice? Who is truly eligible to \n",
      "succeed to the throne? Karikala? Madurandaka?  The more \n",
      "he thought about it, he felt that both sides had equal \n",
      "justification. If it really comes to a confrontation, who will \n",
      "come out victorious? What is my duty in this situation? \n",
      "Aha! I started on this journey from Kanchi while building \n",

      "positions in the Chozla Empire by pleasing the Crown \n",
      "Prince Karikala! I even hoped that in due course I would \n",

      "seems ready to drop! ... Thinking of all such things when \n",
      "he came to bed the second time that night, Vandiya Devan \n",
      "suffered with sleeplessness for a long time. In the end, \n",
      "towards the late hours of the night just as the eastern skies \n",

      "The next morning, Vandiya Devan did not get up even \n",
      "when the golden-red rays of the rising sun fell piercingly \n",
      "upon him. He was jolted awake when Kandamaran came \n",

      "Vandiya Devan said: \"Kandamara! Even though I spent \n",
      "just one night in your house, it was very useful to me. Just \n",
      "one disappointment. You used to recount all sorts of things \n",
      "about your sister, while we were on the banks of the North \n",
      "Pennar. I could not even see her properly! When she \n",
      "peeped from hiding behind your mother, I could glimpse \n",

      "your sister's name?\"\n",
      "\"Manimekala.\"\n",
      "\"Oh! What a delightful name! If her character and beauty \n",
      "are like the name...\"\n",
      "Kandamaran intervened and said in a forlorn voice, \"My \n",

      "sister elsewhere. Manimekala has also agreed.\"\n",
      "Vandiya Devan cheered within his heart: \"Long live \n",

      "was selected to wed Manimekala. They must have pledged \n",
      "her to Madurandaka who stepped out of the closed \n",

       "' The Gypsy Dance\\nBoth friends came out from the inner chambers.  A voice \\nfrom inside called out, \"Kandamara! Kandamara!\"\\n\"My mother is calling me. Wait right here. I\\'ll be back \\ninstantly,\" said Kandamaran as he went inside once again. \\nThe voices of several women talking all at once, the sound \\nof questions being asked one upon the other and \\nKandamaran answering them with some  confusion could \\nbe heard. He also heard the women inside laughing gaily. \\nThe thought that they were perhaps laughing at him caused \\nsome shame and anger in Vandiya Devan. When \\nKandamaran came out, he took hold of his friend\\'s hand \\nand dragged him onwards s aying, \"Come let us look \\naround our palace.\" \\nHe showed him all the beautiful moonlit terraces, music \\nrooms, dance halls, storage rooms, well furnished \\nchambers, living quarters, audience halls, turrets, towers, \\nstables and other places. After a while Van diya Devan \\nasked, \"Kandamara, you made me wait outside your \\nmother\\'s chambers and went in again. At that time what \\nwas so special to provoke the laughter and joy inside? \\nWere the women so happy to see me, your friend?\"\\n\"They were all very happy to meet yo u. In fact my mother \\nand others liked you a lot. But they were not laughing \\nabout you ...\"\\n\"Then why the laughter?\"3\"You know the Lord of Pazluvoor? At this age, after all \\nthese years he has recently married a very young girl. He \\nhas brought her here in a covered palanquin. Apparently he \\nhas kept her locked up in his own chambers without \\nsending her to the inner apartments in the palace. One of \\nthe maids who saw the girl by peeping in through the \\nwindow, came and described her beauty. That is the cause \\nfor the laughter.  They were discussing if she was a \\nSinghala girl, a Kalinga lady or perhaps a maid from \\nChera. You know that the ancestors of the Pazluvoor clan \\noriginally came here from the Chera country?\"\\n\"I have heard it too. Perhaps you had told me ea rlier. \\nThat\\'s OK! Kandamara, how long is it since Lord \\nPazluvoor married this mysterious beauty?\"\\n\"It must be less than two years. He has not left her alone \\nfor even a short while from the time he married her! He \\ntakes his ladylove along wherever he goes;  in a closed \\npalanquin! In fact there has been a lot of sniggering about \\nit all over the country. Vandiya Deva, won\\'t there be \\nridicule and derision if men who are past a certain age get \\ninvolved in such entanglements with women?\"\\n\"I do not think that is the reason. Kandamara, shall I tell \\nyou the real reason for the laughter? Generally women are \\nenvious. Don\\'t think I am belittling the women in your \\nfamily. All womankind is like that! The women of your \\nhousehold are dark-colored beauties. However, Lord \\nPazluvoor\\'s beloved is rosily -fair and golden hued. That is \\nwhy these women do not like her; they are making up \\nstories about her...!\"\\n\"Hey! What is this wonder? How do you know about her \\ncomplexion? Why, have you seen her? Where? How did \\nyou see her? If Lord Pazluvoor knows of this, your life is \\nnot yours!\"\\n\"Kandamara, I am not afraid of all that. You know it. \\nMoreover, I have not done anything improper. I was \\nwatching, one among the crowd on the roadside, when \\nLord Pazluvoor and his retinue went past. The  elephant, \\nhorses, livery, footmen, drummers -- I believe all these \\nwere honors sent by your family to receive him. Is that \\ntrue?\"\\n\"Yes we had sent all those accolades. So what ...?\"\\n\"So what? Nothing. I was just comparing the reception that \\nyou accorded to Lord Pazluvoor and the welcome given to \\nme; nothing else ...\"\\nKandamaran laughed lightly, \"We gave him the tribute and \\nhonor due to the official who levies taxes. A welcome \\nappropriate to a great warrior was given to you! Sometime, \\nwith God Muruga\\'s grace, when you become the son -in-\\nlaw to our house we shall give you the honors due to a \\nbridegroom and welcome you.\" He then added, \"But, you were about to say something \\nelse; we were sidetracked. Oh yes! You were saying that \\nLord Pazluvoor\\'s beloved was  very fair and light in color. \\nHow did you know that?\"\\n\"Lord Pazluvoor was coming seated on the dark, huge \\nelephant from Kadamboor Fort: like Yama, the God of \\nJustice seated upon a huge water -buffalo! All my thoughts \\nwere concentrated on him. While I was building dream-\\nempires about one day becoming famous and powerful like \\nhim, a covered palanquin followed him. Even as I \\nwondered about who could come in a covered palanquin, a \\nhand from inside parted the curtains. I could barely see the \\nface within. The hand and face were golden -hued. That \\nwas all I saw. From what you said just now, I realize that \\nshe must be the beloved of Lord Pazluvoor.\"\\n\"Vandiya Deva, you are a lucky fellow! It is being said \\nthat no man has glimpsed upon that Young -Queen of \\nPazluvoor. You could at least see her hand and face for a \\nsecond. From what you saw, can you guess anything about \\nthe nation which gave birth to that beauty?\" asked \\nKandamaran.\\n\"I did not ponder about it at that time. Now that I think of \\nit, she is perhaps a woman f rom the Kashmir country; or \\nshe is a beauty who hails from the distant lands across the \\nsea like Java, Kadaram (Malaya), Yavana (Greece -Rome). \\nMaybe she is a princess from Arabia: I believe that women \\nin that country are hidden behind veils from birth till\\ndeath.\"\\nAt that moment, the sound of musical instruments could be \\nheard somewhere nearby. Several kinds of drums, flutes, \\npipes and instruments like salli, karadi, parai, udukku  \\nwere being tuned together. \"What is that noise?\" asked \\nVallavarayan.\\n\"The Kuravai Koothu (gypsy dance) is about to begin. The \\ndrums and flutes are being tuned in preparation. Would \\nyou like to watch the gypsy dance? Or, would you like to \\neat early and sleep well?\" \\nVandiya Devan recalled Azlvar -adiyan mentioning the \\ngypsy dance. \"I have never seen the gypsy dance; I must \\nsurely see it,\" he said.\\nWhen they walked ahead a little and turned, they could see \\nthe stage being set for the dancers. The guests were \\ngathering in front of the stage. The stage for the gypsy \\ndance was set in a wide courtyard spread with clean -white \\nsand and situated in a spot surrounded by the palace walls \\nand the towering battlements of the fort. The stage was \\ndecorated with colorful drawings of cocks, peacocks, \\nswans and parrots. They had further decked the  stage with \\nseveral fragrant flower garlands, red -rice popped white, \\ncolored millet, yellow turmeric and other powders, \\nkunrimani (small red berry -beads), and other vivid \\ndecorations.  Tall oil-lamps and flaming torches tried to \\ndrive the darkness away. Bu t the swirling fragrance from 4smoldering frankincense and smokey torches created a \\nmisty screen dimming the lights.  The musicians sat on \\nboth sides and in front of the stage and played their \\ninstruments with gusto. The fragrant flowers, sweet \\nsmelling incense and the drum beats all together made \\nVandiya Devan feel light -headed.\\nAfter all the important guests were seated, the nine \\nmaidens who were to perform the gypsy dance came on \\nthe stage. They wore the tight fitting clothes and \\nornaments suitable for d ancing; they had bell-filled anklets \\non their feet; brilliant red hued flowers of the hill country, \\nflowers favored by the God Muruga, decorated their \\nhairstyles. A long garland woven with such flowers thrown \\nupon their shoulders, seemed to bind them to ea ch other as \\nthey stood upon the stage. In their hands they daintily \\ngrasped beautiful parrots made of sandalwood painted a \\nvivid green.\\nAfter greeting the audience they began to sing and dance. \\nThey first sang a few verses in praise of God Muruga. \\nThey sang of the brave deeds of Muruga; and they sang of \\nhis victorious spear which killed the demons Soora -padma \\nand Gaja-mukha and then dried up the vast ocean. They \\nsang of how he chose for his bride, a maid from the Tamil \\ncountry, a gypsy maid from the hills who was guarding the \\nmillet fields, even as heavenly nymphs offered prayers to \\nmarry the young warrior -God. Their song celebrated the \\ngrace and benevolence of Velan, i.e., Murugan who bears \\nthe spear. The lyrical songs, the fast paced dance, the quick \\ndrum-beats, enchanting flute all in combination bewitched \\nthose who were watching. With the following words of \\nprayer the dance concluded:\\nLet hunger and disease be destroyed;Let enmity be routed;Let rain and fertility increase;Let bounty grow boundless.\\nThe maidens stepped off the stage and moved away.\\nNext, a man and woman dressed as oracles -- thevar-aalan \\nand thevar-aati,  came on stage. The divine -man and \\ndivine-woman wore blood-red clothes. They had brilliant \\ngarlands made of blood -red oleander flowers. They had \\npainted their foreheads with bright red kumkum powders. \\nEven their lips seemed blood -red because they had chewed \\nthe betel leaf and areca -nut. Their eyes seemed blood -shot! \\nThe Velan Attam or oracle dance, began calmly enough. \\nThey danced by themselves and with arms linked together. \\nAs time passed the tempo and passion increased. The \\ndivine-woman picked up a spear from the side. The man \\ntried to pry it from her hands; and she would not let go. \\nThe dance became more frenzied: finally the man leaped \\nacross the resonating stage, jumping high, he plucked the \\nspear from his companion. With an expression of fear on \\nher face she moved away behind the screens.\\nThe divine-man now danced all by himself with more and \\nmore rapid movements. He acted the part of the God Velan killing the demon Soora. Soora\\'s head was chopped off \\nrepeatedly. But the severed -head grew back again and \\nagain. Velan grew angrier and angrier as the head came \\nback again and again. Sparks flew from his eyes. In the \\nend Soora fell dead. Thevar-aalan threw his spear down.\\nBy now all musical instruments were quiet. Only the little \\nhand-held drum, the udukku could be heard. A priest stood \\nnear the stage fanatically beating the hand -drum. Each part \\nof Thevar-aalan\\'s body shuddered. Thos e in the audience \\nwhispered to each other: \"The spirit has materialized.\" \\nSoon the priest looked at the frenzied Thevar -aalan and \\nsaid, \"Vela! Muruga! Commander of the Gods! Lord who \\nkilled Soora! Please reveal your divine predictions to us, \\nyour devotees.\"\\n\"Ask fellow! Ask whatever you want! I will reveal all!\" \\nreplied the delirious man. \"Will the rains be good? Shall \\nwe have plenty of water? Will the land be bountiful? Will \\nour desires be fulfilled?\" asked the priest.\\n\"The rains will be in season. The  waters would be \\nabundant. The land will be fruitful and desires will be \\nfulfilled! But you have not made offerings to my Mother! \\nThe Goddess desires a sacrifice. The Mother -Goddess \\nwants a sacrifice!\" shouted the dancer in delirium.\\n\"What sacrifice?\" asked the priest.\\n\"Will it be offered if I ask?\"\\n\"Yes, we will offer it. We shall surely offer the sacrifice.\"\\n\"She wants the blood of royalty! She thirsts for the blood \\nof a prince from a thousand year -old dynasty!\" shouted the \\nfrenzied dancer in a horrib le voice. \\nThe dignitaries seated in front of the stage -- Lord \\nPazluvoor, Lord of Mazluvoor, Lord Sambuvaraya and \\nothers, they looked at each other. Their eyes seemed to talk \\na secret language. Lord Sambuvaraya seemed to make a \\nsign to the priest.\\nThe priest stopped beating his hand -drum. The dancer \\ndropped upon the stage like a felled tree. The woman \\ndancer ran in to help him out. The audience dispersed \\nsilently. Somewhere outside, the howling of wolves could \\nbe heard.\\nVandiya Devan, who had been watch ing all this with some \\nagitation, looked towards the direction in which the \\nhowling wolves were heard. There, atop the outer ramparts \\nof the fortress, he saw a head! \\nIt was Azlvar-adiyan\\'s head. For a second he was subject \\nto a horrifying feeling. It app eared as if the severed head of \\nAzlvar-adiyan had been placed upon those walls. He \\nblinked his eyelids to look again: the head was no longer \\nthere! He felt ashamed about the worthless fear that had 5taken hold of him. Several other emotions beyond his \\nexperience seemed to agitate his thoughts.\\n*****\\nPonniyin Selvan\\n'"
